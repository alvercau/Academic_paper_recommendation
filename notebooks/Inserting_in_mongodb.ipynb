The example (1) illustrates the phenomena of passivisation  \\nwhich is the topic of our paper.  According to the traditional terminology  (1a) \\ndemonstrates an active structure and (1b) the related passive structure. \\n  \\n(1) \\n\\n(b)  \\n \\n\\nPavel je chválen Petrem \\nPaul   is praised  by Peter \\n\\n(a)  \\n \\n\\nPetr chválí Pavla \\uf0de    \\nPeter praises Paul \\uf0de   \\n\\nThe semantic relation between (1a) and (1b) can be stated as an intuition that both \\nexamples describe the same extralinguistic situation and have ‘similar truth values” \\n(each implies the other). The formal similarity between (1a) and (1b) follows from the \\nfact that both examples contain close to identical lexical material. The distinctions \\nbetween (1a) and (1b) can be summarised as follows.  \\n \\n(2) \\n\\n(a)  Morphology:  \\n\\n(i)  \\n(ii) \\n(iii) \\n\\n(b) \\n\\n(c) \\n\\nthe constituent which is in Nominative in (1a) is in Instrumental in (1b),  \\nthe constituent which is in Accusative in  (1a) is in Nominative in (1b),   \\nthe verb which is finite in (1a) is non-finite in (1b);  \\n\\nLexical material: (1b) contains an additional lexical item, namely a \\nfinite form of a verb být (‘be’), which is not present in (1a);  \\n\\nChange in neutral (unmarked) linear order: the constituent which is \\npreverbal in (1a) is postverbal in (1b), and the constituent which is \\npostverbal in (1a) is preverbal in (1b).  \\n\\n \\nBecause of time and space reasons we are not going to refer to all works which have \\ndealt with the process of passivisation. The analysis of passive structures is a \\nnecessary part of any scientific linguistic framework and it often represents a hallmark \\nfor general theoretical concepts and overall methodology. Thus Czech linguistics in \\nthe second half of the 20th century approaches the topic accentuating the functional \\naspects of the passive.1  \\n\\n \\n                                                 \\n1   In more contemporary frameworks, studies by Ivan Poldauf (1940, 1969) give a \\n\\nrepresentative Prague School structuralist approach and a detail comparison of Czech and \\nEnglish passive structures. A related functional generative linguists (Encyklopedický \\nslovník češtiny, 2002: 146) analyse Czech passive in terms of the functional sentence \\nperspective, e.g. as a means of de-thematisation / de-topicalisation of the agent and/or \\nthematisation of the patient (see e.g. Petr Sgall, 1972). On the other hand, the  proponents \\nof the multilevel valency theory ( see e.g. Encyklopedický slovník češtiny, 2002: 118) refer \\n(see the next page) \\n\\n \\n\\n1 \\n\\n\\x0cPresent transformational generative grammar of a Chomskian type concentrates \\n\\non formal properties and characteristics of passive structures which have not yet been \\nin the centre of attention of Czech linguistics.  In the following paper we are going to \\ndiscuss the formal properties of the Czech analytic passive structures in (1b) using the  \\ncontemporary stage of development of the Chomskyan framework.  Our analysis of \\npassives is thus also meant to show that even languages with rich inflection and \\nrelatively free constituent order, like Czech, can successfully be described in terms of \\ngenerative grammar, and that such an analysis can contribute to the development of \\nthe general linguistic theory as well.  \\n\\n1  THE DESCRIPTION OF THE PASSIVE STRUCTURES \\n\\n1.1  Passive transformation  \\n\\nThe traditional analysis (based on the intuitive classical theories) describes the \\ndistinctions summarised in (2) as the surface distinction in syntactic structure caused \\nby the change of the verbal element in (1a/b). In this sense classical grammar \\nperceives the formal distinctions between (1a) and (1b) as a kind of transformation, \\nthough it does not use the terminology.2  The following (3) gives a schematic \\ndescription of such a transformation starting as a structure (1a) and resulting in (1b).3  \\n \\n(3) \\n\\nTransformation T1 \\n\\n(a)  \\n(b) \\n\\n[NP1]NOM – [V1\\n[NP2]NOM – [V2\\n\\nlex]fin – [NP2]ACC      \\uf0de  (b) \\nbe]fin – [V1\\n\\nlex]part – [NP1]INSTR  \\n\\n \\n \\nThe description of T1 in (3) is obviously neither precise nor full formalisation of all \\npossible structures; e.g. it does not cover the cases in which the active variant contains \\na subordinate clause in the position of the ACC constituent. Because clauses are not \\nmorphologically case marked, the passive variant of this constituent is identical.  \\n\\n \\n                                                                                                                                            \\n(see previous page)  \\n\\nback to Bohumil Havránek (1928: 15), stating that the main function of passive is to \\ninfluence the propositional hierarchy. This idea dates back to František Daneš (1968) and \\nMiroslav Grepl (1973). All the above  authors  take the passive deagentisation for a kind of \\nagent backgrounding / anonymising / generalisation. In their view, moreover, the process \\nof passivisation results in lowering the level of activity (bringing out a level of stative \\ninterpretation of the verb). Within Czech linguistics there is no detailed discussion of the \\npragmatic and stylistic aspects of passivisation but it is widely accepted that the passive is \\na multi-functional structure.  Full bibliography of all the studies will be provided at the end \\nof Part 2. \\n\\n2   The term transformation is used in this section only with a general meaning of ‘structural \\n\\nchange’, because it is exactly the theoretical concept of transformation which \\ndifferentiates many analyses of the passive structures. In section 2.2 we are going to define \\nthe notion of transformation with respect to the framework used in our analysis.  \\n\\n3   The features of verbal tense and agreement are described only schematically in (3). For a  \\n\\ndetailed discussion of the  morphology of V1 and V2 in (3) see section 1.5.4. \\n\\n \\n\\n2 \\n\\n\\x0cWe are also going to ignore all the possible changes in the linear order, one of \\n\\nwhich is illustrated in (4). \\n \\n(4) \\n \\n\\n(a)  \\n \\n\\nPetr         sliboval   Pavlovi,  že    přijde   \\uf0de (b)  \\nPeterNOM promised  PaulDAT  that arrives3SM \\uf0de (b) \\n‘Peter promised to Paul that he arrives.’ \\n\\n(b)  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nPavlovi bylo slibováno (Petrem),     že   přijde \\nPaulDAT was promised  (PeterINSTR) that arrives3SN \\n‘It was promised to Peter (by Paul) that he arrives.’ \\n\\n \\nNor does the transformation T1  in (3)  reflect the cases like (5), with an additional \\ninfinitive,  or (6), in which the active variant (a) contains (apart from NPNOM and  \\nNPACC) another NP or prepositional phrase PP.  The case of such additional NP or NP \\nwithin PP remains unchanged in the passive structures in (b).4 \\n \\n(5) \\n \\n\\nPetr         nutil   Pavla     k  odchodu  \\nPeterNOM forced PaulACC to leave  \\n \\n‘Peter forced Paul to leave.’ \\n\\n\\uf0de (b) \\n\\uf0de (b) \\n\\n(a)  \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n(6) \\n \\n \\n\\n(b)  \\n \\n \\n\\n(a)  \\n \\n \\n\\nPavel     byl    nucen (Petrem)      k  odchodu \\nPaulNOM was forced  (PeterINSTR) to leave \\n‘Paul was forced to leave.’ \\n\\nPetr         sliboval   Pavlovi  žvýkačku  \\nPeterNOM promised PaulDAT chewing-gumACC  \\n‘Peter promised a chewing gum to Paul.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n\\uf0de (b) \\n\\uf0de (b) \\n\\n(b)  \\n \\n \\n \\n\\nžvýkačka               byla slibována (Petrem)      Pavlovi \\nchewing-gumNOM was  promised  (PeterINSTR) PaulDAT \\n‘The chewing gum was promised to Paul by Peter.’ \\n\\n \\n \\n \\nImportantly, the trivial formalisation of T1 in  (3) is not able to capture the process in \\nwhich the active variant  does not contain a transitive verb and some kind of process \\nof passivisation still takes place. The examples of the so called impersonal passive in \\n(7) and (8) have verbs selecting at least one complement in some some other than \\nnominative/Accusative case, i.e. NPGEN/DAT/INSTR in Czech or PP .5 \\n \\n (7) \\n\\n(a)   Učitel           nadržuje   děvčatům   \\uf0de (b) \\n \\nteacherNOM favours3SM  girlsDAT    \\uf0de (b) \\n‘The teacher favours girls.’ \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n(b) \\n\\nJe    nadržováno děvčatům (učitelem) \\nis3S favoured3SN  girlsDAT     (teacherINSTR) \\n\\n \\n                                                 \\n4   Similar examples are discussed here in section 5.4 below.   \\n5   For more detailed analysis of the impersonal passive see section 6.2 below. \\n\\n \\n\\n3 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n‘Girls are favoured (by the teacher).’ \\n\\n \\n(8) \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n(a)  \\n \\n \\n\\n(b)  \\n \\n\\nČlenové         hlasují   o      stanovách   \\uf0de (b) \\nmembersNOM vote3P   about statutesLOC   \\uf0de (b) \\n‘The members vote about the statutes’ \\n\\nJe   hlasováno  o       stanovách  (členy). \\nis3S voted3SN    about statusesLOC (membersINSTR) \\n‘The statutes are  voted about (by the members).’ \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nTo capture the examples (7)/(8) we introduce a description of a transformation T2 in \\n(9) where the label [NP]OBL markes  [NP]GEN/DAT/INSTR.  \\n \\n(9) \\n\\nTransformation T2    \\n\\n(a)  \\n(b) \\n \\n\\n[NP1]NOM – [V1\\n[NP1]INSTR– [V2\\n\\nlex]fin – [NP2]OBL / PP    \\uf0de  (b) \\nbe]fin – [V1\\nlex]part – [NP2]OBL / PP \\n\\n \\n \\nIn the partial transformation T2 the NPNOM constituent in (a)  behaves like in (T1) – i.e. \\nit becomes NPINSTR in (b).

This requirement seems to be supported by the \\nexamples in (10) which demonstrate that a verb without an external (left-side) \\nArgument  cannot have a passive counterpart (impersonal T2)  in Czech.  \\n \\n(10) \\n\\nPetrovi   pomalu otrnuje   \\uf0de (b) \\nPeterDAT slowly   forgets3SN   \\uf0de (b) \\n‘Peter has slowly forgotten about the pain.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n(a)  \\n \\n \\n\\n(b)  \\n \\n \\n\\n* Je     pomalu otrnováno    Petrovi \\n* is3SN slowly   forgotten3SN PeterDAT \\n \\n\\n \\n \\nThe following example (11) demonstrates the impossibility of  transformations T1 /T2 \\nwith verbs which do not have any internal (right-side) Argument NP or PP. Notice \\nthat although the verb can have an adverbial adjunct, contrary to (7) and (8) the \\ntransformation T2 cannot take place either. \\n \\n(11) \\n\\nPetr spí  (v posteli)  \\n\\n\\uf0de (b) \\n\\n(a)  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n                                                 \\n6   The transformation  T1 and  T2 are distinct also with respect to the verbal morphology  \\n\\nshowing the agreement with subject (AGR). While the passive structures arising according \\nto  T1  have an overt surface subject and this subject is reflected by verbal morphology, the \\npassive structures arising via  T2  do not seem to be able to have any overt subject, and the \\nverbal morphology signals a default 3rd person singular neuter.  \\n\\n \\n\\n4 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nPeterNOM sleeps (in bed).  \\uf0de (b) \\n’Peter sleeps in bed.’ \\n\\n(b)  \\n \\n\\n*(Petrem)     je   spáno     v  posteli. \\n*(PeterINSTR) is3S slept3SN in bed. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\nThe distinction between subcategorised vs. free complements of the verb, which \\nseems to be the reason for the distinction between (7)/(8) and (11), is not expressed in \\nthe description of the transformation T2 in (9).7  \\n\\nThus  the formalisations of the passive transformation T1 / T2 in (3) / (9) are far \\n\\nfrom ideal representations of the relevant language process. On one side it would be \\nsuperior to conflate both of them into one more general formula, but on the other side, \\neven in their more detailed form they are not able to capture adequately the \\ncomplexity of the process.  \\n\\n1.3  Base Structures  of the Passive Transformation \\n\\nThe T1 / T2 formulas cannot either express a number of restrictions on passivisation \\nand considering the Czech data, the theoretical nature of transformation is endangered, \\ntoo, especially if it is to be understood as a derivation of some secondary structure (b) \\nfrom a primary/basic/initial structure (a). \\n\\nHowever, though it is usually possible to derive the passive (b) from the active \\n\\n(a), the contrary is more problematic. It is because the active structure must have an \\n(Agent) subject, and this is not obligatorily present in the passive (b). The following \\n(12) shows again that according to the descriptive transformation T1 in (3) the NPNOM \\nsubject of (a) becomes NPINSTR  in (b). \\n \\n(12) \\n\\n(b)  \\n\\n \\n\\nPetr         byl   operován dr.

As the following example shows, its English \\ntranslation is grammatical.    \\n(i)  Peter slept in a bed. \\uf0de  A bed was slept in (by Peter). \\n\\n8   The morphology on active verb has to be marked for some generic subject in any case, in \\n(13) we use the generic 3rdplural[+HUMAN].  Notice, moreover, that with some idiomatic \\npassive sentences the active counterparts with non-metaphorical reading cannot be \\nlogically reconstructed.  \\n(i)    Blbci jsou rovnoměrně rozeseti po celém světě  \\uf0dc   ??  rozesel    blbce po celém světě \\nidiots are equally spread over whole world  \\uf0dc  ?? spread idiots over whole world \\n(see the next page) \\n\\n       \\n\\n \\n\\n5 \\n\\n\\x0c(13) \\n\\n(b)  \\n\\nPetr         byl  operován včera   \\uf0dc  (a) \\nPeterNOM was operated   yesterday  \\n \\uf0dc (a) \\n\\n(a)  \\n\\nVčera        operovali            Petra  \\nyesterday operated3P[+HUM?] PeterACC \\n‘Yesterday they operated on Peter.’ \\n\\n1.3.1 Active and Passive Verb Forms  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nStill, if relation between sentences (1a) and (1b) in the descriptive transformation T1 in \\n(3) is understood as a mechanical algorithm, each passive structure has to have some \\nperhaps only formal active counterpart. This is not true in Czech either. Compare the \\nfollowing examples in (14) and (15),  which demonstrate Czech verbal morphology \\nused to express a complex of temporal features in combination with the features of \\naspect. (14) gives a full paradigm of the imperfective [-PERF] verb chválit ‘to praise’ \\nin which each tense has its active and passive forms.  \\n \\n(14)       chválit (‘to praise’) = [-PERF] \\n\\n \\n\\nPetr        chválí         Pavla  \\nPeterNOM praisesPRES PaulACC  \\n‘Peter praises Paul.’    \\n \\n\\n   \\uf0de  \\n\\n(a’) \\n \\n \\n\\nPavel     je       chválen Petrem \\nPaulNOM isPRES praised  PeterINSTR  \\n‘Paul is praised by Peter.’ \\n\\nPetr        chválil        Pavla  \\nPeterNOM praisedPAST PaulACC  \\n\\n   \\uf0de  \\n\\n(b’)  Pavel    byl         chválen Petrem \\n \\n\\nPaulNOM wasPAST praised PeterINSTR \\n\\n(a)  \\n\\n(b)  \\n \\n\\n(c)  \\n\\nPetr        bude     chválit Pavla  \\uf0de   (c’) \\nPeterNOM willFUT praise PaulACC \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nPavel     bude  chválen Petrem \\nPaulNOM beFUT praised  PeterINSTR  \\n\\n \\nThe examples in (15) show the same active vs. passive couples for the [+PERF]ective \\npochválit ‘to have praised’. As schematically demonstrated in(15a) Czech perfective \\nverbs do not have a present tense.9  The Czech finite AUX (used to form the analytic \\npassive), however, is not perfective, and it can have a full paradigma of three tenses, \\nincluding the present. Given this, the Czech passive sentences with a perfective verb \\nas in (15a\\uf0de) have no active counterpart which could be taken for a base structure \\n(15a) for the transformation T1. Alternatively, the process of passivisation is to be \\nredefined or deprived of the ability to refer to temporal and aspectual features. \\n \\n(15)     pochválit (‘to have praised’) = [+PERF] \\n\\n \\n\\n(a) \\n\\n*Petr     pochvál-??

Apart from that, however, \\nthe reason for this concept is the analogy rooted in Latin classical tradition, i.e. it is \\nbased on the following deduction: \\n \\n\\n(16)(a)  The semantic anf functional relation between the Czech expressions chválím / \\n\\njsem chválen (’I praise’ / ’I am praised’) is the same as the relation between the \\nLatin laudo / laudor;  \\n\\n    (b)  one member of the couple, namely  the active Czech chválím and Latin laudo \\n\\nare formed with a bound morpheme;  \\nthe Latin passive laudor is also formed by a suffix, and therefore the Czech \\npassive  jsem chválen must be a kind of morphological form (affix), too. \\n\\n      (c) \\n\\n  \\n\\nThis approach, however, results in some problems even within the traditional \\nframework. In the following sections we are going to mention some properties of the \\nCzech ’passive voice’ which make this verbal form special and distinct from the other \\nparts of the Czech verbal paradigms.11  \\n \\n                                                                                                                                            \\n(see previous page)  \\n9   The Czech verbal morphology does not have a present for perfectives because as \\n\\ndemonstrated in (14a) compared with (15c), the present tense morphology of [-PERF] is \\ninterpreted as a future with [+PERF].  \\n\\n10   We are not going to discuss the complete active and passive paradigms including the \\n\\noppositions differing in Tense feature, i.e. chválil bych (‘would praise”) and  byl bych \\nchválen (‘would have praised”), imperatives chval (‘praise!”) vs. buď chválen (‘be \\npraised!”), and infinitives chválit (‘to praise”) vs.  být chválen (‘to be praised”); such \\ndiscussion would make the material complex without  changing anything in our analysis. \\n11   As for the appropriate morphological form of the passive verb in Czech, the results (b) of \\n\\nthe passive transformations T1 and T2  applied to (a) seem to be similar to (c). \\n(a)  Zedníci v   opravují školu \\uf0de \\nŠkola        je opravována zedníky \\nSchoolNOM is repaired      masonsINSTR \\nMasonsNOM repair   schoolACC \\n \\nŠkola         se        opravuje \\nSchoolNOM REFL  repairs3S \\nBylo     hlasováno o        zákonu poslanci  \\n(It) was woted3SN   about law      MPsINSTR \\nHlasovalo     se       o        zákonu. \\n(It) woted3SN REFL about law \\n\\n(a)  Poslanci hlasovali o zákonu \\uf0de  (b)  \\n\\nMPsNOM  woted   about law     \\n\\n(b)  \\n     \\n(c)  \\n \\n\\n \\n(c)  \\n\\n(see the next page) \\n\\n7 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0cThe decision whether the so called passive form jsem chválen (’I am praised’) \\n\\nreally is a morphological variant of a given verb (as is postulated by traditional \\ngrammar) should be based on an analysis of the whole complex of the verbal \\nparadigm.  \\n\\n1.4  Considering the Verbal Paradigm \\n\\nIn his thorough discussion of the verbal system in Czech František Kopečný \\n(1962: 95) analysed the analytical past tense as a ‘morphologically analytic form’ \\n(MAF), claiming that the past verbal form chválil jsem (‘I praised’) - though it \\nsuperficially consists of two morphemes - [AUX+past participle] - is in fact a simple \\n(synthetic) verbal form. In the following sections we accept his arguments together \\nwith his terminology for this form. However, for the Czech analytic passive we are \\ngoing to use the term ‘analytic form’ (AF), foreseeing thus our conclusion resulting \\nfrom a thorough comparison of past and passive forms.  \\n \\nchválen (‘I am praised’) and the past chválil jsem (‘I praised’) is that both the forms \\nconsist of two discrete verbal elements: first, a form of an auxiliary být (‘be’) and, \\nsecond, a participle of  a lexical verb.12 This general similarity, however, proves to be \\nthe only characteristic which a careful comparison of the Czech analytic past and \\npassive forms can substantiate/ justify. In the following sections  we are going to \\ndemonstrate a number of widely known tests which show that the two forms deserve \\ndistinct analyses.  \\n\\nThe initial observation one can make comparing the analytic passive jsem \\n\\n1.4.1 The Participles following the Auxiliaries \\n\\nThe distinctions between the Czech past morphological analytic form (MAF) \\nand the passive analytic form (AF) are signalled already by a distinction between the \\nparticiples. The past MAF consists of the AUX and L-Participle (active participle13), \\nwhile the passive AF uses the Passive Participle is formed from the infinitival stem \\nwith the consonant -n-/-t- followed by a gender agreement morphology.14  \\n\\n \\n                                                                                                                                            \\n(see previous page)  \\n\\nTraditional grammars call (c) the reflexive passive. Comparing (b) and (c), however, one \\ncan show many syntactic properties which make the so called reflexive passive distinct \\nfrom the analytic passive (see e.g. Karlík, 2003). Therefore we are not going to discuss the \\nreflexive passive here. \\n\\n12  In his detailed typological study Edward Keenan (1985) shows that a periphrastic \\n\\n(analytic) passive in all Indo-European languages contains an auxiliary which is identical, \\nor similar, to the auxiliary used to form a past Tense. \\n\\n13   The Czech L-Participle is formed from the infinitival stem with the consonant -l- followed \\n\\nby a gender agreement morphology. It originated in Old Slavic as a deverbal adjective and \\nit combined with a copula to form nominal predicates. (See also Rudolf Růžička (1963)). \\nSynchronically, this L-participle is used in Czech to form the analytic past, conditional and \\npast conditional. \\n\\n14   In this section we provide a brief comparison of the  L- and Passive Participles. For a \\n\\ndetailed discussion of the latter see below in sections 5 and 7. \\n\\n \\n\\n8 \\n\\n\\x0cA natural distinction between the verbal complexes comprising the participial \\n\\ncomponents concerns transitivity. The L-Participles (forming the non-finite \\ncomponent of the past MAF) are both transitive (allowing a complement with \\nstructural ACC) and intransitive. On the other hand, the Passive Participles (see also \\nexamples (7) and (8) above) are formed from verbs which cannot have an ACC \\ncomplement.15 \\n \\n(17) \\n \\n \\n\\nJá      jsem    chváli-l-a Marii      \\uf0de  (b)  Marie        je   chvále-n-a \\nINOM AUX1S praised   MaryACC \\n‘I praised Mary.’ \\n\\nMaryNOM  is3FS  praised \\n‘Mary was praiased.’ \\n\\n(a) \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n(c) \\n\\nJá      jsem    spa-l-a.   \\nINOM AUX1S  slept \\n \\n‘I slept.’ \\n\\n     \\uf0de  (d) \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n*Bylo spá-n-o. \\n.*It was slept \\n\\n \\nApart from transitivity, the Czech past MAF is formed relatively regularly from all \\nverbs, while the passive participle is often idiosyncratic, and its productivity is also \\nrestricted by some other factors.  As for syntactic characteristics, the following \\nexamples of ungrammatical co-ordinations in (18b/c) indicate that there can be even a \\ncategorial distinction between the participles. \\n \\n(18) \\n \\n \\n\\nJá  jsem     šel      a     já  jsem      byl unaven.  \\nI    AUX1S  went  and  I    AUX1S  was tired. \\n’I went and I was tired.’ \\n\\n(a) \\n \\n \\n\\n(b) \\n\\n(c) \\n \\n\\n*Já   jsem     šel     a    byl  unaven.  \\n* I    AUX1S  went and was tired \\n\\n*Já jsem    byl unaven a     přece šel. \\n* I  AUX1S was tired   and still    went \\n?? ‘I was tired and still going.’ \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\nAssuming the generally accepted principle that coordination requires like constituents, \\nthese examples strongly suggest that the two kinds of participles do not share their \\ncategory. \\n\\n \\n                                                 \\n15   With the exception of some few Czech verbs with double Accusatives. Passivisation usually \\nshows which Accusative is a structural and which is a kind of a quirky Case used possibly \\nas a result of some lexical-semantic fusion – as in the following example a fusion of a \\n‘teach-learn’ verb. \\n(i) Petr         učil     Marii matematiku  \\uf0de  \\n     PeterNOM taught MaryACC mathACC   \\uf0de \\n\\nMarie byla učena matematiku.  \\nMaryNOM was taught mathACC \\n‘Mary was taught math.’ \\n\\n \\n          ‘Peter taught Mary math.’ \\n\\n(b) \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n(c) \\n \\n\\n*Matematika byla učena Marii. \\n*MathNOM was taught MaryACC. \\n\\n9 \\n\\n\\x0c1.5  The Distinction between the Auxiliaries in Analytic Past and Passive \\n\\nThe main distinction between the verbal complexes of the Czech analytic past \\n\\nand passive is based on the comparison of the AUX components. If both complexes \\nwere paradigmatic forms of a verb, the AUX would have to be analysed as free \\ngrammatical morpheme equivalent to e.g. the bound verbal morphology. However, in \\nthis section we are going to demonstrate that the AUX components of the analytic past \\nand passive are far from being the same, in spite of the fact that they are both forms of \\nthe verb být (’be’) and in most contexts they have identical form.16 \\n\\n1.5.1 Clitic Position \\n\\nThe finite form of the Czech auxiliary být (’be’) in the past ‘morphologically \\n\\nanalytic form’ (MAF) is a clitic, while the finite form of the auxiliary být (’be’) in the \\npassive ‘analytic form’ (AF) is not. The example (19a/ii) illustrate that the past MAF \\nis ungrammatical in the sentence initial position which is unavailable for the Czech C2 \\nclitics but acceptable for the passive AUX být (’be’) in (19b/ii).17  \\n \\n(19) \\n \\n \\n\\nChválil     / unavil         jsem    Petra  \\n(I) Praised/Exhausted AUX1S PeterACC \\n‘I praised/exhausted Peter.’ \\n\\n(a) \\n \\n \\n\\n(i) \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n(b) \\n \\n \\n\\n(ii) \\n \\n\\n(i) \\n \\n \\n\\n *Jsem  chválil / unavil       Petra. \\n AUX1S praised/exhausted PeterACC \\n\\nChválen/Unavený/Studentem/Doma      jsem  stále.  \\nPraised /Tired     /Student      /At home  AM1S allways \\n‘I am always praised/ tired/a student/ at home.’ \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n(ii) \\n \\n \\n\\nJsem   stále   chválen/unavený/studentem/doma. \\nAM1S always praised/tired/student/at home \\n‘I am always praised/ tired/ a student/ at home.’ \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nApart from the passive participle chválen (’praised’),  (19b) provides examples of a \\nCzech adjective predicate unavený (’tired’), a nominal predicate  studentem (’student’) \\nand an Adv/PP doma (’at home’) to demonstrate that with respect to the observed \\ncriterion the finite auxiliary of the passive behaves exactly like the copula/existential \\nverb být (’be’). \\n\\n \\n                                                 \\n16   Some of the diagnostics used in the following sections are  used already in Kopečný (1962) \\n\\nand the works inspired by him, e.g. Miroslav Komárek (1978: 106). In a generative \\nframework a detailed discussion of these properties appears in Jindřich Toman (1980) or \\nLudmila Veselovská (1995, Chapter 4).  \\n\\n17 Descriptive characteristics of various types of clitics (including Czech) can be found in e.g. \\nVoss & Veselovská (1998) or Franks & King (2000). For more discussion concerning the \\ninitial position see also Toman (2000) who discusses apparent exceptions from the \\nobligatory pattern.  \\n\\n \\n\\n10 \\n\\n\\x0c1.5.2 Clitic Reduction \\n\\nAnother property of Czech clitics is their tendency to become phonetically reduced \\nand to ‘lean’ (cliticise) on some phonetically prominent element. The following \\nexample (20) shows that the 2nd person singular form, i.e. jsi (‘are2S’), can be reduced \\nto a kind of bound morpheme –s, which can appear on several hosts.  \\n \\n(20) \\n \\n \\n\\nProč  jsi        často chválil  Petra? \\nWhy AUX2S often   praised PeterACC \\n‘Why did you often praise Peter?’ \\n\\n(a) \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n(b) \\n \\n\\n(c) \\n(d) \\n\\nProč-s           často chválil Petra?  \\nWhy-AUX2S often   praised PeterACC \\n\\nProč často-s chválil Petra?  \\nProč často chválil-s Petra?  \\n\\n \\nIn the above example (20), the AUX was a part of the past MAF. A contrasting (21) \\nshows that the same reduction is impossible with the AUX is a component of the \\npassive AF.  \\n \\n(21) \\n \\n \\n\\n \\nProč  jsi        často chválen/unavený/studentem/doma?  \\nWhy AUX2S often   praised/ tired/ student/ at home \\n‘Why are you often praised/ tired/ a student/ at home?’ \\n\\n \\n(a) \\n \\n \\n\\n(b) \\n\\n(c) \\n(d) \\n\\n` \\n\\n* Proč-s        často chválen/unavený/studentem/doma? \\nWhy-AUX2S often  praised/ tired/ student/ at home  \\n\\n* Proč často-s chválen/unavený/studentem/doma?  \\n* Proč často chválen/unavený/studentem/doma -s? \\n\\n1.5.3 Colloquial/Dialectal Forms and Zero Morphemes \\n\\nThe distinctions between the AUXs of the past MAF and passive AT include also the \\nformal realisation of the paradigm. In  standard Czech, the AUX of the passive AF \\ncontains an initial prothetic consonant j-.18  The forms without the consonant are \\ntaken for secondary / colloquial / restricted to certain contexts (e.g. negation).On the \\nother hand, with the AUX of past MAF the form without this initial consonant j- is \\ntaken as standard and the forms with j- are secondary / influenced by spelling (see \\nKomárek (1978: 105)).  \\n\\nThe acceptable varieties are listed in (22). Apart from the initial prothetic \\nconsonant j-, notice that in (c) the 3rd singular/plural AUX of past MAF is a zero \\n\\n \\n                                                 \\n18   In Old Slavonic the prothetic consonant j- was preposed to the words starting above all \\nwith an ‘e-’ vowel; compare the Latin est and Czech jest (‘to be’). The process reflects a \\ntendency for alternating syllabic sonority (a CV-CV pattern) in Old Slavic: prothetic  \\nconsonants were inserted to prevent hiatic structures  from becoming a part of the \\nfollowing words. \\n\\n \\n\\n11 \\n\\n\\x0cmorpheme, while the AUX of the passive AF in (c’) must have an overt form je/jsou \\n(‘is3S/P ‘) identical with the forms of the copula/existential be.  \\n \\n(22)   Standard/primary j- and secondary/colloquial (j-) / Zero AUX3S \\n\\n           Past MAF: (j-), Ø3 \\n\\n         Passive AF: j-, *Ø3 \\n\\n(a) \\n\\n(b) \\n\\nJá (j)sem  chválil.  \\nI   AUX1S praised \\n‘I praised.’ \\n\\nTy (j)si  chválil.  \\nYou AUX2S praised \\n‘You  praised.’ \\n\\n(c)  On *je/Ø chválil.  \\nHe AUX3S praised \\n‘He praised.’ \\n\\n(a’)  Já jsem  chválen. \\nI   AUX1S praised  \\n‘I am praised.’  \\n\\n(b’)  Ty jsi chválen.  \\n\\nYou AUX2S praised \\n‘You are praised.’ \\n\\n(c’)  On je/*Ø chválen. \\nhe AUX3S praised \\n‘He is praised.’ \\n\\n \\nThe following (23b) recalls the possibility of reduction mentioned in the preceding \\nsection 1.5.2. (23a/c) moreover demonstrate that in those cases where reduction is not \\npossible, Moravian dialects use a distinct class of agreement morphology for the \\npassive AUX1/2S and copula/existential být (’be’): su (‘am1S’), seš (‘are2S’).

On the other hand, the finite AUX of the \\npassive AF (as well as the copula/existential být ‘be’) can be used in the imperative \\n(25a’), the infinitive (25b’) and the future form budu (‘will-be’) (25c’). \\n \\n(25)  \\n\\nImperative / Infinitive / Future of AUX být (’be’) \\n\\nPast morphological analytic form             Passive analytic form  (+copula/existential be) \\n\\nIMP   (a)   *Chválil buď!         \\n*praised AUXIMP  \\n\\n(a’)  Chválen buď!   \\npraised AUXIMP  \\n’Be praised!’ \\n\\nINF \\n\\n(b)  *(Musel) být chválil. \\n\\n(b’)  (Musel) být      chválen/-zlý/-studentem/-doma.  \\n\\n*(had to)AUXINF praised \\n\\n(had to) AUXINF praised /-nasty /-a student /-at home \\n’He had to be praised.’ \\n\\nFUT  (c)  *Já budu chválil.  \\n\\n(c’)  Já budu      chválen/-zlý/-studentem/-doma. \\n\\n*I  AUXFUT  praised  \\n\\nI   AUXFUT  praised /-nasty /-a student /-at home \\n’I will be praised /-tired /-a student /-at home.’ \\n\\n1.5.5 Iterative Aspect \\n\\nAnother distinction between the two AUXs concerns the morpheme expressing \\nprogressive aspect. The finite AUX of the Czech passive AF can express progressive \\niteration, as illustrated in (26), by the aspectual suffix -va- on the passive participle \\n(26a), as well as on the AUX (26b) or both. The contrasting example (27) \\ndemonstrates that with the past MAF the aspectual morpheme -va-  can appear only on \\nthe past participle, i.e. the finite AUX is not able to appear in the progressive form.  \\n\\n \\n                                                 \\n20 Why this can happen only in the 1st singular form is unknown to us. \\n\\n \\n\\n13 \\n\\n\\x0c(26) \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n(27) \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n(a) \\n \\n \\n\\n(b) \\n\\n \\n\\n(a) \\n \\n \\n\\n(b) \\n\\nJá jsem     chválen   /chválí-vá-n  \\nI   AUX1S  praised    /praisedPROG   \\n‘I am praised (repeatedly).’ \\n\\n    \\n\\n \\n\\nJá bý-vá-m       chválen  /chválí-vá-n.  \\nI   AUXPROG/1S praised   /  praised PROG \\n‘I am being praised (repeatedly).’ \\n\\nJá jsem      chválil   /chválí-va-l  \\nI   AUX1S   praised    /praisedPROG   \\n \\n‘I praised / was repeatedly praising.’ \\n\\n    \\n\\n*Já bý-vá-m       chválil  /chválí-va-l  \\n*I   AUXPROG/1S praised   /  praised PROG \\n\\n1.5.6 Negation \\n\\nAnother clear distinction between the past and passive finite AUXs  can be found in \\ntheir distinct combinations for expressing negation. In Czech the sentence negation is \\nexpressed by a negative prefix ne-. As illustrated in (28a), with the past MAF the \\ngrammatical position of this negative prefix ne- is on the past participle. The \\ncontrasting (28b) shows that with the passive AF, the sentence negative prefix appears \\non the AUX.21  \\n \\n(28) \\n \\n \\n\\nJá jsem     ne-chválil   \\nI   AUX1S  not-praised  \\n‘I did not praise.’ \\n\\n*Já ne-jsem      chválil \\n*I    not-AUX1S praised \\n\\n(a) \\n \\n \\n\\n(a’)  \\n \\n\\n(b) \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nJá  ne-jsem      chválen/-unavený/-student/-doma. \\nI    not-AUX1S praised /-tired /-a student /-at home \\n‘I am not praised /-tired /-a student /-at home \\n\\n1.5.7 Ellipsis \\n\\nThe ability to carry a negative prefix (and perhaps also the clitic characteristics) seem \\nto be a source of another distinction between the AUXs. The following example (29a) \\nshows that in short answers the AUX of the passive AF can replace the whole verbal \\ncomplex (while  the passive participle cannot). In  the parallel (29b) the AUX of the \\npast MAF is illustrated as ungrammatical and the shortest possible answer contains the \\nL-participle.22 \\n \\n(29) \\n\\n(a) \\n \\n \\n\\nJsi        chválen často? \\nAUX2S praised often?  \\n‘Are you praised often? \\n\\n- Ano, jsem.   / *Ano, chválen.    \\n- Yes, AUX1S / *Yes, praisedSM.     \\n- Yes, I am.’ \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n                                                 \\n21 For the possibility of negating the passive participles see section 7.1.5 below. \\n22 The feature distribution between their AUX and participle components is  identical with \\npast  MAF and passive AF. The verbal agreement features are therefore  not crucial for \\n\\n(see the next page) \\n\\n \\n\\n14 \\n\\n\\x0c(b) \\n \\n \\n\\nChválil   jsi       Petra?  \\nPraised AUX2S PeterACC? \\n‘Did you praise Peter? \\n\\n- *Ano, jsem.     / Ano, chválil.     \\n- *Yes, AUX1S. / Yes, praisedSM.    \\n- Yes, I did.’ \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n1.5.8 A Conclusion based on the Comparison of the Auxiliaries and Participles \\n\\nThe above sections demonstrated a number of distinctions between the AUXs \\ninvolved in forming the past and passive verbal complexes. By all the criteria applied, \\nthe Czech past AUX showed a higher level of grammaticalisation and lack of \\nindependence. This past AUX  behaves like a free equivalent of the bound verbal \\nmorphology - i.e.  it encodes (i) a person-number agreement ending plus (ii) indicative \\ncharacteristics of mood signalled by an initial morpheme (stem) js-. This  feature \\ncomplex is comparable with the feature content of the AUX used to form the Czech \\nconditional, as illustrated in  (30). In (30a) we show a past AUX combined with the L-\\nParticiple to form the past MAF. In (30b)  the same L-Participle combines  with a \\nconditional AUX. This conditional AUX signals the combination of (i) agreement \\nfeatures together with (ii) conditional morpheme (stem) by-. \\n \\n(30) \\n \\n\\n(a) \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nJá by-ch             chválil \\nI   AUXCOND-1S praisedL-PRT \\n‘I would praise’ \\n\\n(b) \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nJá js-em       chválil \\nI AUXIND-1S praisedL-PRT \\n‘I praised’  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nOn the other hand, with respect to the tests demonstrated in (19) -(29), the finite AUX \\nused to form a Czech passive AF behaved identically with a copula or existential verb \\nbýt (‘be’). In other words, it was repeatedly revealing properties typical for  lexical \\nverbs. As for feature characteristics, passive AUX was able to carry the features of (i) \\nperson/number agreement, (ii) aspect, (iii) tense, (iv) modality.  \\n\\nGiven the above clear distinction between the AUX components, it is far from \\n\\nobvious that the analytic passive represents a kind of verbal paradigm like the analytic \\npast tense.  Consequently, if a passive form is not a part of verbal paradigm, the \\nanalogy in (16c) is incorrect for Czech. Consequently one cannot claim that the \\npassive transformation involves only a morphological change within a single (verbal) \\ncategory. The observation stated in (2b) is to be taken more seriously, because the \\nproperties of the passive AUX demonstrate that the passive structures do contain some \\nadditional lexical material with respect to their active counterparts. \\n\\n2  PASSIVISATION IN TRANSFORMATIONAL GENERATIVE \\n\\nGRAMMAR \\n\\nThe preceding Section 1 has summarised several imperfections in a traditional \\ntransformational description and explanation for formating the analytic passive in \\nCzech. We mentioned  problems with semantic equivalence and the definition of the \\n\\n \\n                                                                                                                                            \\n(see previous page)  \\n\\ngrammaticality (in the correct answer in (29b) the participle does not show the features of \\nthe 1st person singular). \\n\\n \\n\\n15 \\n\\n\\x0cbase (active) structure. Many arguments were presented to demonstrate that active and \\npassive verbal forms are not an optional paradigmatic variation in Czech. All those \\ndata suggest that the passive transformation is not tenable in the form of T1 in (3).  \\n\\nWe conclude that, above all, it is not possible to perceive a transformation as a \\n\\nprocess which applies a mechanical algorithm (e.g. transformation T1) to an existing \\nbase structure (a) to derive a new structure (b) using the same lexical repertory and \\nwith no change of meaning.  \\nIn this paper we want to show an alternative analysis of the Czech analytic passive \\napplying a more contemporary concept of transformational process. We want to \\ndemonstrate that the modern generative framework is able to explain the phenomena \\nin more general terms and with a higher degree of explanatory accuracy.   \\n\\n2.1  Transformational and Lexicalist Theories of Passivisation \\n\\nA process of passivisation was described as a transformation sui generis in the earlier \\nstudies by Noam Chomsky (see Chomsky 1957, Chapter 5 and 1965, Chapter 2). In \\nthe period of the Extended Standard Theory Chomsky divided the original complex \\ntransformation into two relatively independent processes (see Chomsky, 1972). \\nPassive structure was presented as a result of (i) a movement of the active-object NP \\ninto the position of a passive-subject, and (ii) independent movement of the active-\\nsubject NP into the position of passive-agent-instrumental PP. 23   \\n\\nAlso in the 70s a first influential lexicalist theory arises within a generative \\n\\nframework represented by a detailed study by Robert Freidin. He discusses above all \\nthe adjectival properties of passive participles and proposes that active and passive \\nverbal forms are independent formatives appearing in the Lexicon (see Freidin, 1975, \\nChapter 2). For Freidin participles are of primarily adjectival character and the \\nLexicon lists them  as a basic form preceding  the related verbal lexemes. Freidin’s \\nnotion of categorial distinctions, however, is not strict, and he follows Chomsky \\n(1970) in allowing lexical items to not in fact always have a full categorial \\nspecification.  Friedin’s analysis was followed by e.g. Joan Bresnan (1977, 1982) and \\nother studies within lexical functional grammar, which does not employ \\ntransformations at all (e.g. Höhle (1978)).  \\n\\nLexicalist theories of the passive propose that the active and passive \\n\\nmorphology is already added to the stem in the Lexicon and their projection therefore \\nresults in autonomous (independent and therefore distinct) syntactic structures. The \\nability of a verb to form a passive, is an information stored in the Lexicon, and there is \\nno purely structural restriction on passivisation. In an extreme form such lexicalist \\nhypotheses can result in claiming that all the observed similarities between active and \\npassive structures are a result of a pure chance. \\n\\nOn the other branch of possible analyses, Freidin’s (1975) lexicalist study was \\n\\nrejected by e.g. Thomas Wasow  (1977) who provided a number of arguments in \\nfavour of a transformational approach. This descriptively rich study proposed an \\nanalysis based on an explicit relation between active and passive structures. The \\nauthor distinguishes between adjectival and verbal passives, provides a wide range of \\n\\n \\n                                                 \\n23   In a given period see similar analysis in  e.g. Lakoff and Ross (1976). \\n\\n \\n\\n16 \\n\\n\\x0cdiagnostics to argue for their categorial specificity, and claimes a transformational \\nrelation only for verbal passives.24 \\n\\nIn the following generative era of Government and Binding, Chomsky (see e.g. \\n\\nChomsky (1981:48-50)) supplemented his passive transformations (object to subject \\nmovement and subject to  PPINSTR movement) by a Case Filter, proposing that the \\nnon-verbal characteristics of passive participles (wrt to ACC Case assignment ) are a \\nresult of its neutralised verbal character.25  \\n\\nIn this period, the transformational theories of the passive assume that in the \\n\\nprocess of passivisation the syntactic positions of a base structure are changed and \\nconsequently also the government relations. The change in government results in the \\nchange of morphology of the specific lexical items. These analyses usually notice that \\nthe loss of Argument Θ1 in the passive structure correlates with the loss of a structural \\nAccusative case. In elementary form this correlation was stated by Luigi Burzio as \\nfollows in (31).26 \\n \\n(31)   Burzio’s Generalisation (see Burzio 1986:178-9, 184) \\n\\na)  A verb which lacks an external Argument fails to assign Accusative Case. \\nb)  A verb which fails to assign Accusative Case fails to theta-mark an \\n\\nexternal Argument.  \\n\\n2.2  Minimalist Transformations \\n\\nNone of the influential contemporary transformational frameworks accept the concept \\nof transformation as it was introduced in section 1.1, i.e. as an algorithm expressing a \\nlinear and morphological change leading from a base (primary, deep) structure to \\nsome derived (secondary, surface) structure.27 Since the end of the 60s, sentences (1a) \\nand (1b) are still taken as related, but the relation is not stated in terms of their mutual \\n \\n                                                 \\n24   Some of Wasow’s diagnostics are going to be applied in this study in sections 4 and 7.3. \\n25   Similar analyses within the G&B framework can be found in e.g. Oswaldo Jaeggli (1986) \\nor in the independent study by Paul Postal (1986), who provides a wide range of (English) \\ndata-based argumentation in favour of the transformational approach. \\n\\n26   The possible realisation of the Agent theta role is discussed here in 7.1.3. As for the lack of \\n\\nAccusative in the passive structures, see  a detailed, cross-linguistic and summarising \\nstudy by Baker, Johnson and Roberts (1989, Chapter 4). The authors claim  that the \\nabsorption of Accusative is a less general phenomena than the lack of the Agent Theta \\nrole. We assume that the structural characteristics are language specific and the data are \\nobscured by the existence of non-structural quirky Accusatives which are not subject to \\nBurzio’s Generalisation (31). \\n\\n27   In early Chomskyan grammar the initial (base, kernel) sentence was identified as the \\nactive structure, alternatively as some active-like semantic structure (see e.g. Charles \\nFillmore, 1968). In the present transformational approach this concept is still possible in \\nframeworks referring to the notions of ‘diathesis’, i.e. a mechanism correlating a \\nhierarchy of grammatical functions/roles (assuming a subject-object asymmetry) with \\nsome semantic/thematic hierarchy. Those notions are more frequent in typologically \\noriented studies, for Slavic see e.g. the influential studies by Chrakovski (1974, 1981). For \\nCzech a similar concept of transformation is still used in more popular linguistic studies \\nand textbooks e.g. Grepl & Karlík (1998) or Příruční mluvnice češtiny (1995). \\n\\n \\n\\n17 \\n\\n\\x0crelation but in terms of the relation of each of them to some shared more general \\n(deeper) structure.  \\n\\nIn this study we are going to analyse the passive structures in Czech using the \\n\\nconcept of transformation as it appears in the later period of Principles and \\nParameters, i.e. in the 90s and at the break of the century. From the original \\nGovernment and Binding framework we accept the modular approach to the language \\nsystem. As for structural and processual terminology we are going to use Minimalist \\nconcepts.28  \\n\\nMinimalism uses the term transformation for a universal structure-building \\n\\nmechanism. A transformation is a process which applies to the Numeration (a set of \\nlexical items selected from the Lexicon) to build a structure which will at the end of \\nthe derivation be interpretable at both the Acoustic and the Interpretation interfaces. \\nTo ‘converge,” the elements in the structure must contain only interpretable features, \\nwhich means that the uninterpretable features must be checked and eliminated in a \\nrelevant phase of the derivation. The features are checked by transformations which \\nenlarge the structure bottom-up, i.e. all the changes are taking place at the top of the \\nstructure and are motivated by the feature content of the highest lexical element/head.  \\n(32) gives the two kinds of transformations, both of which enlarge the structure and \\nare motivated by the need to check the uninterpretable feature of the top head.  \\n \\n(32)  Typology of Transformations (see Chomsky, 1995) \\n\\na)  Merge, which adds a new element from the Numeration set to the top of \\n\\nthe existing structure,  \\n\\nb)  Move, which moves an accessible element from within the existing \\n\\nstructure to the top position.   \\n\\n \\nThe transformation Move in (32b) is closer to the classical concept of transformation \\nbecause it removes parts of already existing structure based on their categorial \\ncharacteristics and syntactic complexity.29 \\n\\nThe merged/moved elements contain a (categorial) feature which is required to \\n\\nmatch (and thus check and usually also eliminate) a ‘strong feature” of a structure’s \\ntopmost head. The processes of Merge and Move are triggered by the need to check \\nthe strong feature of this head, and to do so the Merge/Movement of a simple feature \\ncould suffice. The idiosyncratic properties of a language specific Lexicon and \\nindependent principles licensing extraction, however, usually require more syntactic \\n(and phonetic) material to Merge/Move and the moved feature thus ‘pied pipes” more \\nmaterial. \\n\\nBecause of the way transformations are motivated, Minimalism claims that all \\n\\ntransformations are feature-checking and therefore all are obligatory. In this view \\n\\n \\n                                                 \\n28   Most of the terminology is discussed with Czech examples in Encyklopedický slovník \\n\\nčeštiny (2002) and related to Czech traditional grammar in Veselovská (2001c).   \\n\\n29   For the moment (and with respect to the phenomenadiscussed) we can see no principled \\ndistinction between Move leaving traces and the more current Copy theory of movement. \\nWhichever proves to be superior is in our view applicable to our analysis. \\n\\n \\n\\n18 \\n\\n\\x0cactive and passive structures, no matter how similar they may be, have to start with \\ndistinct Numeration sets.30 \\n\\n2.3  The Verbal Projection \\n\\nIn this section we introduce the structure of a verbal phrase which we will use to \\nanalyse Czech analytic passives later on.  \\n\\n2.3.1 The Lexical and Light Verbal Heads \\n\\nFor our analysis of the Czech analytic passive we accept the following three \\n\\nassumptions:  \\n(a) \\n\\nverbal Arguments are generated in the minimal domain of the verbal head, i.e. \\ninside the Vmax,  \\nduring the derivation the Arguments can move to higher positions in the tree,  \\nthe verbal head can move from its base generated position to some \\nhierarchically higher head position as well.  \\n\\n(b) \\n(c) \\n\\nWe will work with the split VP projection based on the structures used in e.g. Jean-\\nYves Pollock (1989), Margaret Speas (1990) or Richard Larson (1988, 1990).31 As for \\nthe number and labels of the functional heads dominating the verb, we generally \\naccept the minimalist account as presented in Chomsky (1995), i.e. we are going to \\nrestrict their number to only those which are signalled by some regular and overt \\nmeans. Therefore we are going to use \\n\\n \\n(i) \\n\\n(ii) \\n\\n(iii) \\n\\n‘V’ for a lexical head related to the subcategorisation of internal verbal \\nArguments,  \\n‘v*’ for a head of the so called ’light’ verb related to the projection of the \\nexternal Argument (thematic subject, i.e. the highest theta role Θ1), and  \\n‘T’ for a functional projection related to the verbal grammatical categories, \\nnamely to modality. This is also a possible position for establishing verbal \\nagreement with  a subject. 32 \\n\\n \\nThe relations among the above heads is as schematically shown in (33).  \\n \\n(33)  \\n \\n \\n\\nTP → T, v*P \\nv*P  → v*, VP \\n\\n(a) \\n(b) \\n\\n \\n                                                 \\n30   It is beyond the scale of this study to decide to which extent the minimalist  transformation \\n\\nremains transformational in the traditional sense and to which extent it in fact \\nincorporates a  lexicalist approach. \\n\\n31   A split VP for the Czech verbal complexes is discussed and used in e.g. Veselovská (1995) \\nand Petr Kosta 2001. For the most contemporary framework for Slavic languages  see e.g. \\nŽelko Bošković (2002). \\n\\n32   The label used for this perhaps complex functional head was INFL, I, AGRS+T etc. We are \\n\\ngoing to use a kind of conflated form of this head, just in section 7.2 we will propose the \\npossible existence of a separate functional head Aspect.   \\n\\n \\n\\n19 \\n\\n\\x0cIn a standard verbal projection the head v* has a strong categorial feature, for which \\nwe use the notation <+V>, which it checks by transformation Move (32b); v* attracts \\nthe closest verbal element, i.e. the head V. A transitive verb is therefore a complex \\nhead [v*V+v*] resulting from the unification of V and v*:  \\n\\nAs for the verbal functional head T, we assume that a finite T has (i) an \\n\\nagreement feature [+AGR], or better a strong feature <+D> / <+EPP> , which attracts \\na subject DP to the position of SPEC(T), and (ii) a verbal feature <+V>  which attracts \\na verbal complex [v*V+v*].  \\n\\nThe following scheme in (34) demonstrates the extended verbal projection \\n\\ndescribed above. It is a multi-level projection with co-indexed heads which (following \\nJane Grimshaw (1990))  become united at least at LF.

However, the concrete realisation of the complex \\ndepends on language specific lexical entries for the verbal paradigm, i.e. the LF \\ncomplex [T V+v*+T] can be phonetically realised by one free morpheme with a \\ncomplex internal structure or by several free (more or less complex) morphemes.  \\n\\n2.3.2 Generating the Verbal Arguments \\n\\nAs for the positions in which the subcategorised verbal Arguments enter the structure, \\nwe will accept the Larsonian shell (Larson (1988)) in assuming that the Arguments are \\ngenerated in the positions of specifiers (SPECs) of relevant verbal heads. We also \\n\\n \\n                                                 \\n33   The feature content of T and the specification of the features as strong vs. weak is \\n\\nlanguage specific. Therefore the proposed movements can take place within the syntactic \\nderivation (in the form of phrasal or head-to-head movement to satisfy ‘strong features’) \\nor at the level of LF (in the form appropriate for the LF movements to satisfy ‘weak \\nfeatures’). \\n\\n \\n\\n20 \\n\\n\\x0caccept Richard Kayne’s (1991) claim concerning the uniqueness of the SPEC position. \\nBecause a unique SPEC position allows generating only one Argument related to one \\nhead, the analyticity of the verbal projection, as proposed in  (33) and (34), namely the \\npresence of the light verb v*, is a necessary condition for transitivity.   \\n\\nThe base generated structure of an intransitive / unAccusative34 verb is \\n\\nillustrated in (35): it does not need a double-level structure of V and v*, because one \\nhead is enough to generate the Argument with a single Theta role Θ1.35 \\n \\n(35)  \\n \\n\\nIntransitive VP: the head V0 assigns Θ1 to its SPEC(V) \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n        Vmax \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nSPEC(V)  \\n        Argument Θ1 \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\nV0 \\n \\n \\n\\n            \\n        \\n \\n\\nHowever, a standard transitive projection must apart from V generate also a light verb \\nv*, as demonstrated in (36).

We thus assume that a lexical \\nentry subcategorises (selects) its Argument within its minimal domain and that these \\nArguments must be formally licensed. The formal licensing of DPs we are going to \\ncall Case, and we are going to distinguish lexical and structural Cases.38  \\n\\nThe schemes in (34), (35) and (36) enable us to describe the mechanism of \\n\\nstructural Case assignment with the Czech verb. We assume that Case assignment is a \\nresult of the active role of verbal heads in the process of derivation, namely, as \\nsuggested in Chomsky (1995: Chapter 2) in discussing the role of AGR heads, we \\nassume that a structural Case can arise only when the case assigning verbal head (and \\nperhaps also the DP itself) moves. Such “inductive“ case assignment is standard with \\nstructural Nominative moving into SPEC(TP), and we are going to extend this notion \\nhere to structural Accusative as well. The assumed verbal structural case assigning \\nconditions are summarised in (37) below. \\n \\n(37)  Verbal Structural Case  \\n\\n \\n\\nNOM is assigned in SPEC of an activated v*, i.e. after the attraction of  v*→ \\n\\nACC is assigned in SPEC of an activated V, i.e. after the attraction of V→ v*.  \\n\\n(a) \\nT,  \\n(b) \\n \\n\\nIn our analysis of the Czech passive structures we are first going to concentrate \\n\\non the structural explanation of the properties of the passive AUX exemplified in \\ndetail in the previous section 1.5. Then we will pay more attention to the second \\ncomponent of the analytic passive: to the passive participle. \\n\\n3  PAST AND PASSSIVE FINITE AUXILIARY BE \\n\\nIn the above section 1.5 we listed a number of distinctions between the finite AUXs \\nused to form the Czech analytic past and passive. Traditional diagnostics indicate that \\nthe past AUX is a highly grammaticalised free inflectional morpheme (compare the \\n\\n \\n                                                 \\n38   The division into lexical (oblique) and structural (configurational) Case in Slavic is \\n\\ndiscussed in e.g. a detailed study by Leonard Babby (1987:116). The author proposes a \\nCase Hierarchy which states that in a derivation lexical Case assignment precedes the \\nstructural Case: the Lexical Case is assigned at the beginning of the derivation because it \\nis a result of a specific lexical subcategorisation. Structural Case follows, because it \\ndepends on a specific structure. Steven Franks (1995:95-96) accepts Babby’s Case \\nHierarchy, calls the lexical Case an inherent Case and relates the levels of the Case \\nassignment to the levels of derivation: the inherent [+Oblique] case is assigned at the D-\\nStructure and the structural [-Oblique]) Case at the S-Structure. We accept the above \\nhypotheses and will refer to them later on.   \\n\\n \\n\\n22 \\n\\n\\x0cterm MAF ‘morphologically analytic form’), while the passive AUX shares most of \\nits properties with a lexical verb (with the copula/existential být ‘be’).  The notion of \\ngrammaticalisation and MAF vs. AF terminology is just a way to expositorily \\ndistinguish the observed morpho-syntactic distinctions.39 \\n\\nWe propose that the universal structure of a verbal projection as described in \\nthe preceding section 2.3 is able to capture some of the distinctions between the past \\nand passive AUXs through distinct distribution of these elements in the tree.  \\n\\nWe propose that the distinctions between the AUXs in passive AF and past \\n\\nMAF as described in 1.3.1 can be explained by generating the AUX of the past MAF \\nin the position T in the structure in (34) while the AUX of a passive AF is generatet \\n(merged) in the position of  v*. This proposal is described in more detail and \\ncommented on in the following section.  \\n\\n3.1  The Position of the AUX of the Czech Past MAF  \\n\\nOur approach to the analysis of a verbal projection pressuposes an analytic \\n\\nconcept of a extended projection, i.e. a projection layered according to the categories \\ndistributed into separate functional heads (“FH”), of which the scheme in (39) is one \\nconcrete example. The existence of such FHs is a part of any current analysis. We are \\nassuming the concept of FHs as defended in e.g. the study by Jamal Ouhalla (1991), in \\nwhich the author claims that the number of active functional heads is language \\nspecific, as is also specific the distribution of formal features into those heads.  \\n\\nThe simplified scheme in (39) below illustrates the location of the components \\nof a Czech past MAF jsem schválil (’AUX1S praised‘), together with the distribution \\nhypothesised here of verbal categorial features.   \\n\\nThe scheme is based on adopting Baker’s Mirror Principle. This principle is  \\n\\nderived from the  Head Movement Constraint originally proposed by Lisa Travis \\n(1984). In Baker (1988) HMC is reduced to a variation on the Empty Category \\nPrinciple (see Chomsky, 1981, 1986), i.e. related to a requirement on proper \\ngovernment of the trace of a removed element. \\n \\n(38) \\n\\n(a)   Head Movement Constraint (Baker, 1988:53) \\n\\n \\n\\n0 may only move into the Y\\n\\n0 which properly governs it. \\n\\nAn X\\n\\n  \\n \\nThe Head Movement Constraint (HMC), together with the introduction of a number of \\nFHs, seems to provide clues for the ordering of words and morphemes and as such it  \\nwas introduced in Baker (1985) as the ‘Mirror Principle’ (38b).\\n\\n 40 \\n\\n \\n                                                 \\n39   The distinction in the level of grammaticalisation we take as a signal of ongoing \\n\\ndiachronic change—progressive grammaticalisation in the sense of e.g. Tesniére (1959). \\nAs for the diachronic development of the verb be  in Indo-European and English in a \\ngenerative framework, see e.g. Ian Roberts (1985, 1991) works which include diachronic \\nstudy of passive AUXs. \\n\\n40   The Mirror Principle (38b) can be predicted within a framework which allows only left \\nadjunction or substitution (cf. Kayne, 1994), and assumes the adjacency requirement on \\nhead movement that makes it impossible to skip an intervening head, e.g. HMC.  The \\nMirror Principle is therefore widely accepted. Its implementation, however, depends on \\n\\n(see the next page) \\n\\n \\n\\n23 \\n\\n\\x0c(b)   Mirror Principle (Baker, 1985) \\n \\n \\n\\nThe order of affixes on a verb reflects the order in which  operations \\non the verb have taken place. \\n\\n \\n(38)) \\n \\n \\n \\nGiven (38b) we now build the scheme (39) with Neg (Negation head) between T and \\nv*. This lower position ensures that the AUX in a past MAF will not be able to carry a \\nnegative prefix, as demonstrated in (28) above.  \\n \\n(39) The Position of the AUX of the Czech Past MAF:  T0 \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n       \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nTP \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nT0 \\n<+D/N> \\n\\n \\n\\nNegP   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n    \\n\\nNeg0 \\n\\n \\n\\nvmax \\n\\n         \\n\\n v0 \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nVmax \\n\\n      V0       v0 \\n      [±NEG, ±ASP] \\n\\n \\n\\n        jsem      (ne-)    schválil \\n       AUX1S   (not-)   praisedSM \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nThe functional head T in the scheme (34)/(39) is one of the positions in which the \\nagreement morphology is checked, as marked by a feature <+D/N> in (39), and it \\ntherefore now follows that the finite AUX of the past MAF will carry this agreement \\ninflection and not the inflection of e.g. an infinitive or imperative.  \\n\\nThe exact distribution of the features [+ASP, +T] between V and v* will not be \\n\\ndetermined here. In any case we assume that those features are features of the verbal \\nprojection and not of T. This structure thus predicts that the AUX of the past MAF \\ncannot carry any Tense itself, but rather appears in a present/unmarked form. 41 \\n\\n \\n                                                                                                                                            \\n(see previous page)  \\n\\nthe complexity of the extended projections being used and above all on the number of \\nfeatures which a specific author is willing to locate in one functional head. None of the \\nabove mentioned criteria make the choice of underlying analysis unique, given that the \\nprocedure of checking features is not fully worked out. Thus even within the most elaborate \\nextended projections of VP, very different results can be achieved, as evidenced by the \\nobviously distinct analyses in e.g. Pollock (1993) or Hilda Koopman (1993).  \\n\\n41   In Czech Past tense is expressed by a combination of the L-participle and indicative AUX, \\n\\nand there is no obvious finite past morpheme in Czech.  \\n\\n \\n\\n24 \\n\\n\\x0cAccording to (39) the Czech AUX in the past MAF is categorially T with a \\n\\nsubcategorisation given in (40).42 \\n \\n(40) \\n\\nbýt (‘be’): T, [__+V] ...... grammatical formative / free inflectional  \\nmorpheme.43 \\n\\n \\nBecause the subcategorisation requires the category T to have a verbal \\nsister/complement, it guarantees the distribution of AUXs in combination with the L-\\nparticiple.  \\n\\nThe categorial label T ensures the formal properties of the AUX as described \\n\\nin 1.5. The fact that it is a functional head, moreover, reflects its high level of \\ngrammaticalisation and possibly even its clitic characteristics, because the functional \\nhead T has always been related to grammatical formatives and in Chomsky (1981) it \\nwas even labeled INFL to reflect its complementarity with verbal flection.  The \\nterminology used by Kopečný (1962: 95) to define the grammatical nature and \\ninflectional nature of the AUX in a past MAF refer to these same characteristics. \\n\\nIn the scheme (39) we do not make any exact claim concerning the position of \\n\\nthe L-participle. It seems standard to call it “a verb,” and since it has no restriction \\nrelated to transitivity we assume it represents a complex [v*V+v*]. As for the \\ndistribution of agreement features between the AUX and L-participle,  the process is \\ndescribed  in  more detail in Veselovká (2002a).44  \\n\\n3.2  The Position of the AUX of the Czech passive AF \\n\\nThe following scheme (41) shows the finite AUX in a passive AF generated as a head \\nof the ‘light verb’ v* with the proposed subcategorisation být: v*, [__ +V], parallel to \\n(40). This  scheme uses a feature distribution similar to that in (39). The feature \\ndistribution explains the characteristics of the passive AUX (generated in v*).45 \\nThe position of the AUX in v* in (41) explains a number of properties of the passive \\nAUX illustrated in 1.5.: its ability to carry negation, modality, and aspect, in other \\nwords its fully verbal characteristics. The position in v* is also a very important for \\nthe definition of the following passive participle, which is the sister/complement of v*. \\nWe will discuss this topic later on. \\n \\n                                                 \\n42   The blank in (40) signals the position of the element (here the AUX ‘be’), and the following \\nbracketted [+V] is the categorial feature of the subcategorised complement (in Minimalist \\nterms the feature <+V> which the AUX carries and has to check). \\n\\n43   The full (idiosyncratic) paradigm for the lexical item být (‘be’) with the subcategorisation \\n\\n(40) is in the left column of the examples (22) and (23): (j)sem/(j)su, (j)si/’s, Ø, (j)sme, \\n(j)ste, (j)sou.. \\n\\n44   Veselovká (2002a) claims that the agreement can be formed in two phases: first between \\n\\nthe subject in SPEC(v*) and the participle in v*, and second between the functional heads \\nD and T in the position SPEC(T). This cyclic approach  suggests that NOM case can be \\nlicensed by the L-participle itself, as suggested by the existence of covert/empty AUXs in \\n(22c) and (24c). According to (36a) NOM is assigned by v*,  plausibly after the LF \\nunification of the verbal extended projection. \\n\\n45   The distribution of the features of [+Aspect] and [+Iteration] in (41)  is based on the \\n\\ndiscussion in the following section 4.1. For the discussion of future tense, see section 7.2. \\n\\n \\n\\n25 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n(41)  The Position of the AUX of the Czech passive AF: v* \\n\\n \\nTP \\n\\n       \\n\\nT0 \\n<+D/N> \\n\\n \\n\\nNegP   \\n\\n \\n\\nNeg0 \\n\\n \\n\\nvmax \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n    \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n         \\n         v* \\n[±NEG] \\n[±TENSE]              \\n[±ITER]    \\n\\nVmax \\n\\n V0 \\n\\n \\n        [±ASP] \\n\\n-- \\njsem  byla \\n\\njsem/su \\n \\n\\n       chválena \\n      chválena \\n\\n                          \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n              \\n \\n\\n \\nJá \\nJá    \\n\\n3.3  A Note about the Subcategorisation of the verb be  \\n\\nIn (40) we mentioned a subcategorisation of the Czech verb být (‘be’) which is used as \\nan AUX in the past MAF. It is repeated in (42a). (42b) is a subcategorisation proposed \\nfor the be which is used as the AUX with the passive AF, and (42c/d) gives the \\nsubcategorisation of the copula and existential be, demonstrating that the \\nsubcategorisation of the Czech verb být (‘be’) in fact allows a sister/complement of \\nany category. Possible restrictions on its use should thus be more a problem of \\nlicensing the complement than of the features of the verb být (‘be’) be. \\n\\n \\n(42) \\n \\n\\n(a) \\n(b) \\n(c) \\n(d) \\n\\nbýt: T, [__+V]  \\nbýt: v*, [__ +V]  \\nbýt: V, [__+N/Adj]   .......... copula \\nbýt: V, [__+Adv/PP] .......... existential be \\n\\n.......... AUX in past MAF \\n.......... AUX in passive AF \\n\\n \\nHowever, (42) seems not to reflect the general feeling of the contrasts between  the \\ntwo AUXs. Notice that in (42a) and (42b) the AUXs are distinguished only by their \\nown categorial label (T vs. v*) although our diagnostics showed substantial \\ndistinctions between the two. On the other hand we demonstrated that there are hardly \\nany distinctions between  (42b) and (42c/d). In the next  Section we are going to bring \\nthe (42) closer to the intuitive division; namely we are going to propose that after a \\nmore careful analysis of the passive participle, there is hardly any syntactic distinction \\nbetween the AUX in (42b) and the copula in (42c). Both of them select a [+N, +V] \\ncomplement, and a Czech passive participle can satisfy this subctegorisation in the \\nsame way as the AP part of the verbo-nominal predicate as in (42c). \\n\\n \\n\\n26 \\n\\n\\x0c4  CATEGORIAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PASSIVE \\n\\nPARTICIPLE  \\n\\nOur analysis of the analytic Czech passive is based on analyses of both of its \\ncomponents. After dealing with the AUX in the preceding sections we are going to \\nlook more closely at the past participle. We are going to argue that a number of \\nspecific properties of the passive participle can be explained if we accept a more \\ncomplex categorial characterisation of this element.  \\n\\nWe want to show that passive participles are syntactically derived adjectives \\ncombined in expected fashion with an unmarked copula. This approach requires an \\nanalytic notion of the verbal projection as  proposed in (36). We want also to show \\nthat if the transitive verbal complex [v* V+v*] is filled by two separate elements \\ninstead of one, namely if the head v* does not c-command VP (attracting its head V) \\nas in (36), but instead v* c-commands an AP syntactically derived from a V head, the \\nresulting structure will show exactly the properties attributed to passive structures. \\nOur analysis will be able to show that Burzio‘s Generalisation (31) is then a \\nconsequence of such a phase-by-phase derivation.  \\n \\nIn the following sections we are going to evaluate the verbal properties of the \\npassive participles. We are going to argue that passive participles show (i) a restricted \\nset of verbal characteristics and (ii) a correspondingly augmented set of properties \\ntypical for adjectives.46 \\n\\n4.1  Aspect   \\n\\nThe existing influential analyses of Czech verbal aspect are far from being \\ncompatible,  so therefore we must briefly summarise our concept of the phenomena. \\nWe believe that the problems of these analyses are based on complexity of the \\nphenomena: what is traditionally called ‘Aspect‘ is plausibly a complex of several \\ndistinct features which as a combinatorial whole is interpreted in terms of \\nprogressiveness /length /repetitiveness /perfectivity etc. applied to the verbal stem.   \\n\\n4.1.1 [±LS/A] Aspect \\n\\nThe following (43) summarises our characterisation of one of the Aspect features in \\nCzech. \\n \\n(43) \\n\\n[±LS/A] Aspect \\n\\n- It is an interpretable feature present in the  \\ncategorial feature complex of the category V.  \\n- Its positive value is interpreted as “limiting the State \\nand/or Action” . \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n                                                 \\n46   The following sections apply the tests used in the classical study by Wasow (1977), who \\nuses both semantic and syntactic arguments to distinguish between adjectival and verbal \\npassive participles. Similar diagnostics are used in Edward Keenan (1985) for several \\ntypologically distinct languages, in Jaeggli (1986), or Levin & Rappaport (1989). The \\nsame diagnostics are also used in the detailed study of Russian participles by Maaike \\nSchoorlemmer (1995). \\n\\n \\n\\n27 \\n\\n\\x0cThe traditional test using the combination with aspectual verbs seems to be a \\n\\nThe [±LS/A] Aspect is thus a semantic feature in Czech which is an integral part of a \\nspecific verbal entry in the Lexicon. If a Verb is selected into the Numeration set, it is \\nselected together with its [±LS/A] Aspect feature. The range of the feature is [+LS/A] \\nfor perfective verbs V[+LS/A], or unmarked for imperfective V[±LS/A].47  \\n \\nreliable diagnostic for the Aspect feature: only [±LS/A] Aspect infinitives in (44a) can \\ncombine with aspectual verbs like začínat (‘start‘) , while the [+LS/A] Aspect \\ninfinitives in (44b) are completely ungrammatical.  \\n \\n(44)  Combination of aspectual verbs with Aspect [±LS/A]  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n(a) \\n\\nstart + V[±LS/A]   \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n= začíná       pršet,  chválit, psát,   psávat, opisovat, přepisovat, brát \\n ‘starts to - rain, - praise, -write, -write, -copy,      -copy,        -take’  \\n\\n(b) \\n\\n*start + V[+LS/A]  \\n\\n= *začíná zapršet, pochválit, opsat,  přepsat, vzít, dát… \\n ‘starts to -rain, -praise, -copy, -copy, -take, -give’   \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nThe lexicalist hypothesis for Czech [LS/A] Aspect embodied in (43) is supported also \\nby the possibility of idiosyncratic and idiomatic, non-paradigmatic derivation of forms \\nwith distinct settings of the [±LS/A] feature.48  \\n\\n4.1.1.1 \\n\\n The Resultative feature [±R] \\n\\nApart from a restricted ability with temporal aspect verbs, the feature of  [LS/A] \\nAspect is also relevant for semantically salient combinations with temporal adverbials.  \\nThe verbs containing a feature of  “achieving the result“ (resultatives [+R]) together \\nwith the feature of [±LS/A] show distinct compatibilities with adverbials denoting \\nlasting vs. momentary action.

If any Czech Aspect is to be represented  by a separate functional head inside \\nthe extended verbal projection, the feature [+ITER] is a plausible candidate. [±ITER] \\nis an optional feature which is a part of the verbal paradigm. In the unmarked form the \\ncategory of V is [-ITER].  \\n \\n(46) \\n\\nIteration [±ITER]   - Is an optional interpretable feature of a Czech verb  \\n- It is interpreted as “repeating the State and/or Action“  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nTo support (46) we can compare the verbal category of [±ITER] with the nominal \\ncategory of [±PLURAL]: not only is the interpretive distinction between singular and \\nplural nouns  comparable with the distinctions between [±ITER] verbs; the similarity \\nof the two contrasts is found especially in the productivity and systematic regularity of \\nthe morphological patterns.49 \\n \\n(47)    (a) \\n\\n[±PLURAL] is an optional nominal feature which is expressed by a  \\npredictable morphology and forms a part of regular nominal paradigm. \\n\\n(b) \\n\\n[±ITER] is an optional verbal  feature which is expressed by a  \\npredictable morphology (suffixes ‘-á/-íva-a-‘) and is a part of regular  \\nverbal paradigm. \\n\\n \\nIn both cases the regularity and predictability is bound to the presence of another \\nfeature on the lexical head category. \\n \\n(48) \\n\\n[+PLURAL] requires the presence of a feature [+COUNTABLE],  \\n[+ITER] requires the presence of the feature [±LS/A].  \\n\\n(a) \\n(b) \\n\\n \\nOn the other hand, comparing [PLURAL] with [ITER] Aspect, we can find some \\ndistinctions as well: e.g. the feature of number is expressed by a inflectional \\nmorpheme fused with the feature of Case, while the feature of [ITER] Aspect is \\ncarried by a separate morpheme traditionally analysed as a separate affix. The \\ndistinction, however, may reflect only distinct diachronic processes and does not \\nnecessarily undermine (46).  \\n\\n \\n                                                 \\n49   For similar hypothesis see already Wolfgang Dressler (1968) and also the comments \\n\\nrelating progressive forms to number in Robert Fiengo (1974). \\n\\n \\n\\n29 \\n\\n\\x0c4.1.3 Aspect of passive participles: Action vs. State \\n\\nAccording to (43) the [±LS/A] Aspect is a categorial feature of the lexical V, and \\nselecting a lexical verb into a Numeration must result in selecting a [±LS/A] Aspect. \\nIf the Czech passive participles can carry the marked feature of  [+LS/A]  they should \\ncontain a verbal lexical entry. As for interpretation, traditional grammar interestinglz \\nmakes a distinction between passive participles carrying a distinct feature setting of \\n[±LS/A] in combination with Tense. In the present tense, the passive participles \\nformed from  [±LS/A] imperfective verbs are interpreted as actions, as in (49a), while \\nthe passive participles derived from the [+LS/A] verbs are statives/ resultatives, as in \\n(49b).50 \\n  \\n(49) \\n \\n \\n\\nJá jsem chválen . \\nI   am    praised[±LS/A]  ................................... action   \\n ‘I am (just being) praised.‘ \\n\\n[±LS/A]  \\n \\n \\n\\n(a) \\n \\n \\n\\n     \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n(b) \\n \\n \\n\\n[+LS/A]  \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nKřeslo    je zhotoveno    z     bambusu \\nArmchair is made[+LS/A] from bamboo........... state \\n’The armchair is made from bamboo.‘ \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\nThis interpretive distinction is an argument for a categorial distinction. \\n\\nAccording to the typological categorial correlations, the feature [+ACTIVITY] is a \\nprototypical feature of the category of verb, while the feature of [+STATE] is \\nprototypically adjectival.  The interpretation of passive participles thus signals their \\nmixed categorial characteristics, namely that at least some of them (above all those \\nderived from perfective verbs) show more adjectival than verbal properties.  \\n\\nAs for the feature of  [±ITER] Aspect, according to (46) it is an optional \\n\\ngrammatical feature which is added to an existing verbal categorial stem: it is \\nexpressed by an affix -vá- preceding the participial affix -n/t-. The following \\nexamples demonstrate that passive participles have, if any, at best a very restricted \\nability to carry an [+ITER] affix.  \\n  \\n(50) \\n\\n(a) \\n\\n*Diktát     byl   psá-vá-n         každý pátek \\n* dictation was written[+ITER] every Friday \\nRoughly ‘Dictations were being written each Friday.’  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n(b) \\n \\n\\n*Ten test byl  opiso-vá-vá-n docela  pravidelně. \\n* the test was copied[+ITER]     rather  regularly \\nRoughly ‘The test was being copied rather regularly.’ \\n\\n \\nAssuming that the [+ITER] Aspect (like the category of [NUMBER]) is not a feature \\nlocated on the lexical V head but on some separate c-commanding verbal functional \\n\\n \\n                                                 \\n50   In the past and future all Czech passive participles are ambiguous with respect to the \\n\\naction/ state distinction, i.e. both interpretations are possible depending on context; see \\nMluvnice češtiny II (1986: 173). \\n\\n \\n\\n30 \\n\\n\\x0chead, the above examples show that such a verbal functional head may be not active \\n(present) with passive participles.51 \\n\\n4.2  The Distribution of the Verbal Features between the AUX and Past \\n\\nParticiple \\n\\nThe verbal features which can be realised on a Czech verb are (i) Tense [±TENSE], \\n(ii) modality [±MOD] and (iii) Iterative Aspect [±ITER]. We are not going to discuss \\nthese features here in a lot of detail. We will only observe to which extent these verbal \\nfeatures are realised on separate constituents of the analytic passive verbal complex, \\nnamely on the AUX and on the passive participle.  The distribution is demonstrated in \\nthe following (51). It shows that all those verbal features are morphologically realised \\non the AUX only and the participle (in bold) remains in the same form.52 \\n \\n(51) \\n\\n[TENSE]  \\n\\n(a) \\n\\nJsem      / jsem byla  / budu            chválen \\nI am[PRES] was[PAST]    /  will-be[FUT] praised \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n(b) \\n\\n[MOD] \\n\\n(c) \\n\\n[ITER]  \\n\\n  Bych byla (bývala) \\n   chválen \\nI would be (have been) [-REALIS] praised \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nJsem       / bývám              chválen  \\nI am[-ITER] am-being[+ITER]  praised \\n\\n \\nThe above example (51) thus illustrates that the passive participle is not able to reflect \\nthe features typical of the Czech verbal paradigms. \\n\\n4.3  Verbal vs. adjectival inflection \\n\\nA non-verbal characteristic of the passive participle is most clearly seen in its \\n\\nagreement morphology. Czech is a language which has a rich system of agreement \\nmorphology reflecting on another category the Phi features of a related nominal \\ncategory. As illustrated in (52), the category related to the noun and reflecting its Phi \\nfeatures can be either a verb or an adjective. Verbal agreement (i.e. the agreement of \\nthe subject with relevant predicate) is signalled by an agreement in pronominal (D) \\nfeatures: i.e. features of person and number. The agreement of an adjective with its \\ngoverning noun reflects nominal (N) features: i.e. the features of gender and number.53  \\n \\n(52) \\n\\nVerbal Agreement: PERSON (+ Number)→ pronominal (D) features \\n\\n(a) \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\njá/ty/on/-a/-o        děl-ám / děl-áš / děl-á  \\nI  /you/he/she/it    do1S     /  do2S     /do3SM/F/N \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n                                                 \\n51   As discussed in e.g. Veselovská (2001b) the feature of NUMBER in Czech is plausibly \\n\\nlocated on a separate functional head above N, e.g. on D, while the feature of countability \\nis a feature of the lexical category N. \\n\\n52  For the participial morphology see (53) below, and some further examples in section 1.5.5. \\n53   For simplicity and space reasons we are going to ignore a more detailed discussion of \\n\\nnumber agreement, which is present in both cases. For Slavic unmarked and marked \\ncombinations see e.g. Franks (1995). \\n\\n \\n\\n31 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n(b) \\n\\nAdjectival Agreement: GENDER (+ Number) → nominal (N) features \\n\\n \\n\\nzelen-ý / zelen-á / zelen-é       strom  / střecha / jablko \\ngreenSM / greenSF  / greenSN     treeSM / roofSF   / appleSN \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nThe following example (53) shows that both components of the Czech analytic \\npassive exhibit agreement with the subject constituent. However, the feature \\ndescription demonstrates that the AUX reflects the features of PERSON (+ Number) \\ndefined above in (52a) as typical for a verbal agreement, while the passive participle \\nmorphologically realises the features of GENDER (+ Number) exemplified above in \\n(52b) as typical for adjectival morphology.54   \\n \\n(53) \\n\\n \\n\\njse-m  / js-i    / je   chvále-n(ý)  / chválen-a  / chválen-o \\nam1S  / are2S  / is3S  praisedSM    /  praisedSF   / praisedSN \\n‘I am/you are/(s)he/it is praised’ \\n\\n \\n\\n4.4  Adjectival Derivation \\n\\nIn the preceding sections we listed some properties of passive participles which \\nindicate their mixed verbal and adjectival characteristics. According to Chomsky \\n(1981:50) participles are a “neutralised category.” He, however, uses the term rather \\nvaguely and in the same study he labels the same structures in distinct ways. In our \\nanalysis of the Czech passive we assume that although some lexical items may have \\nmixed characteristics, syntactic processing does not tolerate ambiguous labelling or \\nneutralisation: i.e. each item must be uniquely labelled with respect to its category, \\nwhich in a crucial way influences how syntactic derivation proceeds.  \\n\\nThe categorial ambiguity observed with participles can, however, be a result of \\n\\n(i) a complex character of some lexical elements which consist of several parts with \\ndistinct categorial labels, and (ii) a cyclic derivation which allows a phase-by-phase \\ncomposition of some morphologically complex structures. In other words, if a \\ncompound consisting of categorially distinct components is created during a process \\nof building a syntactic structure, there may be distinct categorial labels used for the \\ncompound at distinct levels of the derivation.55 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n                                                 \\n54   Arancha Mateos (2000) describes the two kinds of agreement with respect to obligatory vs. \\n\\noptional characteristics, demonstrating that the adjectival agreement seems to be cross-\\nlinguistically less ambiguous, less related to semantics and allows no optionality in its \\nparadigms. For discussion and examples of the contrasting verbal vs. adjectival \\n(compound / diachronically pronominal) agreement see e.g. Rochelle Lieber (1980), \\nBresnan (1982:21-24), Levin & Rappaport (1986), and Schoorlemmer (1995, Chapter 4). \\nCompared with the languages discussed in the studies above, Czech morphology seems \\nstandard. \\n\\n55   For more aspects of apparent categorial ambiguity see Veselovská (2001d), which  argues \\n\\nthat distinct categorial labels also result from the existence of independent criteria \\nrelevant at different linguistic levels. Mixed categorial characteristics are then an \\nargument in favour of the autonomy of the levels of phonology, morpho-syntax, and \\nsemantics and not an argument in favour of fuzzy or intermediate categories. In this study \\n\\n(see the next page) \\n\\n \\n\\n32 \\n\\n\\x0c4.4.1 Interpretation of the complex feature clusters  \\n\\nAs for interpretation, in a modified valency theory as presented in e.g. Petr Karlík \\n(2000) the categorially complex lexical elements are interpreted with respect to the \\nfollowing (54). \\n \\n(54)  \\n\\nInterpretation of Categorial Features  \\n\\n(A)  Inheritance: the complex inherits the features of its components (the \\n\\n“Percolation Principle”). \\n\\n(B)  Priority of a Strong Feature: in case of an incompatible feature complex, \\npriority is given to the feature defined (within a given paradigm) as strong. \\n\\n(C)  Transparency of weak features: features which are compatible are weak and \\n\\nremain transparent.  \\n\\n(D)  Internal Opacity: the features of the components which are combined within the \\n\\nLexicon are opaque, with the exception of the features of the categorial head. \\n\\n \\nIn this study we are going to propose a structural definition of transparency based on \\nthe notion of a syntactic head (and the projected phrasal category). \\n\\n4.4.2 Syntactic Structure of a Derived Adjective \\n\\nAs for its syntactic structure, we take a passive participle for a kind of syntactically \\nderived adjective. Its structure is exemplified in (55), which shows a categorial head \\nA0 compounded from three morphemes of a distinct kind, namely from (i) a lexical \\nmorpheme V0, (ii) an adjectival derivational suffix A0 (-n-/-t-), and  (iii) an \\ninflectional morpheme of adjectival Phi feature (Gender + Number) agreement.56 \\n\\n \\n                                                                                                                                            \\n(see previous page)  \\n\\nwe propose a syntactic analysis of a specific phenomenon, and therefore we will discuss \\nprimarily the morpho-syntactic characteristics related to it, rather than the more general \\nquestion. \\n\\n56   A plausible categorial label for these Phi features would be [+N]. This label would, \\n\\nhowever, require more detailed treatment which we will leave for future research. In this \\nstudy we are going to call the Phi feature morpheme ‘an (adjectival) agreement’ \\nmorpheme/ending. \\n\\n \\n\\n33 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n(55)  Passive Participle as a Derived (verbal) Adjective \\n \\n\\n   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n[AV+A]0 \\n\\n     \\n V0                    \\n\\nA0 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nchvál-          \\nzabi- \\n\\n \\n\\n        -n-   +  [-0/-a/-o]    \\n         -t    +  [-0/-a/-o]     \\n\\n(‘praised‘) \\n‘killed‘) \\n\\nverbal   \\nlexeme   \\n\\nadjectival   + inflectional \\nsuffix    \\n\\nending \\n\\n \\nAs for complex words as in (55), a current generative framework generally accepts a \\n‘mild’ lexicalist hypothesis (as introduced in Chomsky, 1970), which proposes that \\nsome complex words are created by syntactic derivations, but others are a result of a \\nlexical process, stored in the Lexicon and entering the derivation as one unit with \\nopaque internal structure and interpretation. This study accepts such an intermediate \\nposition, too, assuming that depending on its characteristics, some morphology is of \\nlexical origin while other morphology is syntactically derived. 57  \\n\\n4.4.2.1  Lexical and Grammatical Elements of the Structure  \\n\\nIn her influential comparative study Hagit Borer distinguishes between lexical and \\ngrammatical elements (see Borer, 1984) and proposes that it is the repertory of \\ngrammatical formatives which is responsible for the main distinctions between \\ntypologically distinct languages. She also develops the concept of distinct behaviours \\nof the grammatical and lexical elements in her more contemporary Parallel \\nMorphology (see Borer 1993, 1997). Borer claims that grammatical morphemes are \\nstored in a separate module of Morphology and they are added to the lexical elements \\nduring the process of syntactic derivation.  \\n\\nA precise distinction for the process of insertion of grammatical elements into \\n\\nthe syntactic derivation can be found in a detailed study by Joseph Emonds (2000). \\nThe author distinguishes two kinds of morphemes which are defined by their feature \\ncontent:  \\n \\n(56)  Lexical vs. grammatical Morphemes \\n\\n(i) \\n\\nLexical items contain idiosyncratic semantic features and must enter the \\nderivation at its initial level of the phase. They are stored in the Lexicon.  \\n\\n \\n                                                 \\n57   The strong version of the lexicalist hypothesis (see e.g. Di Sciullo & Williams, 1987) takes \\n\\nall word-internal morphology for lexicon-internal. On the other hand, the syntactic \\napproach (represented by e.g. Baker, 1988) derives all, or at least most morphology by a \\nsyntactic process. The intermediate position is typical for studies carried out in the \\nframework of Distributed Morphology (see Halle  & Marantz 1993). \\n\\n \\n\\n34 \\n\\n\\x0c(ii)  Grammatical morphemes contain only the features that a specific language \\naccepts as grammaticalised (conceptual and grammatical features). These are \\nstored in a separate module of  the “Syntacticon”.  \\n\\n \\nThe Syntacticon items can enter the derivation at three levels:  \\n \\n(57)  Levels of Insertion of Grammatical Morphemes \\n\\n(A) \\n(B) \\n(C) \\n\\nthe initial (Deep Structure/lexical) level of a phase,  \\nthe syntactic processing preceding the end of a given phase (Spell Out),  \\nthe level of PF, i.e. post-phasal insertion (concerns above all the morphemes \\ntraditionally labelled as inflection).  \\n\\n \\nEmonds (2000) develops his tripartite insertion hypothesis with a number of examples \\nand also illustrates the process for English derived passive adjectives in a way which \\nis fully compatible with the analysis we propose here.58 \\n\\n4.4.2.2  Phases of Derivation \\n\\nThis study will use Emonds’s hypothesis mentioned in the above section by \\ndistinguishing two kinds of morphemes characterised by their feature content with \\nconsequently distinct behaviours within syntactic processing. As for the possible \\nlevels of the phase in which the morphemes can get involved in the process of \\nderivation, we suppose these are derived from a standard T-Model exemplified in \\n(58). The three phases are numbered as (A) Initial Numeration, (B) Syntax (pre-Spell \\nOut), (C) PF. \\n \\n(58)  Levels of the Derivation \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n(D) Logical Form \\n \\n(interpretive interface)\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n(A) Initial \\nNumeration \\n\\n \\n\\n              (B) SYNTAX \\n\\n   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\nWe are not going to discuss other conditions determining the level of insertion \\n\\n \\n(perception/auditory interface)  \\n\\n(C) Phonetic Form \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n(for details see the above cited literature), assuming only general principles of \\nProcrastinate and structural economy.    \\n\\n \\n                                                 \\n58   A very similar though terminologically distinct conception from Borer’s Parallel \\n\\nMorphology has also been applied in detail in the study of Russian participles by Maaike \\nSchoorlemmer (1995). The tripartite level of insertion is used for the analysis of Czech \\nderived nominals in Veselovská (2001a). \\n\\n \\n\\n35 \\n\\n\\x0c4.4.3 Phase-by-phase Derivation of a Derived Adjective  \\n\\nFollowing a standard claim prevailingly generally accepted in a generative \\n\\nframework we do not expect that a transformation can change a categorial label of a \\nspecific lexical entry.59 In conformity to this, the complex structure in (55) does not \\nrepresent any categorial ambiguity because the hierarchy among the elements in (55) \\nis defined by their position within the complex: the head within the word is \\ndetermined following the Right Hand Head Rule.60 \\n\\nHowever, we propose that the complex word need not exist in its full \\n\\ncomplexity illustrated in  (55) from the beginning of the derivation. Assuming the \\ntripartite level of insertion of morphemes into the structure, the components of the \\ncomplex in  (55) clearly represent distinct kinds of morphemes and if so, some of \\nthem can enter the structure in several distinct syntactic phases.   \\n\\nAs for the individual components in the derived (deverbal) adjective in (55): \\nthe verbal stem is a lexical morpheme with possibly idiosyncratic semantic features \\nand it is therefore expected to be present in the Initial Numeration, i.e. in (58A). On \\nthe other hand, the final agreement morphology of the complex is an uninterpreted \\ninflection and its insertion is likely to be as late as at PF, i.e. in  (58C). The middle \\ncomponent - the adjectival derivational suffix is a grammatical element, too. As \\nsuch, its presence in the structure is possible but not required in the initial Numeration. \\nWe propose that this productive adjectival suffix can be inserted to the derivation at \\nall possible levels  (58A/B/C). After the insertion of this A0 morpheme the lexical \\nhead V0 becomes opaque (non-head), and the complex is analysed as A0. 61 \\nDepending on the level at which the A0 head becomes active, we can \\n\\ndistinguish three structures, all of which represent the [AV+A] complex as in (55). \\n\\n4.4.3.1  Lexical Derivate  \\n\\nBecause grammatical morphemes can in principle enter a derivation in any level, the \\ncomplex V+A in (55) can be created already within the Lexicon and enter the Initial \\n(semantic) Numeration as a whole. This derivate is a result of lexical  process and its \\ninternal structure is syntactically opaque. Such a [AV+A] enters syntactic processing \\n\\n \\n                                                 \\n59   In the Minimalist Program Chomsky (1995) repeats this proposal under the name of the \\n\\nInclusiveness Condition, which does not allow a transformation to add any new material to \\na structure which has already been built. The author, however, does not take e.g. an \\ninflection for a separate syntactic item, so his Inclusiveness Condition does not address \\nstructures like (55). \\n\\n60   The Right Hand Head Rule is discussed and justified in Rochelle Lieber (1980). It states \\n\\nthat the categorial head of a complex (multi-categorial) element is its rightmost \\ncomponent.  \\n\\n61  If (55) results from Merging separate components in a step-by-step manner the Right Hand \\n\\nHead Rule forces distinct categorial characteristics of the complex before and after the \\ninsertion of the right-most component. Such a change, however, does not mean a violation \\nof the Inclusiveness Condition, because the complex is at each level of derivation defined \\nas one specific category and the change is not a result of transformation in the traditional \\nsense, here probably (32b), but of standard insertion of new material by a process of e.g. \\nMerge, as in (32a).  \\n\\n \\n\\n36 \\n\\n\\x0cwith a category of adjective (with a right-hand head A0), projects according to its \\ncategorial label A and as an adjective is interpreted at the level of LF . At the \\nperception/auditory (phonetic) level it shows a complex morphological structure with \\nadjectival inflection.  Its morphological structure is semantically transparent but \\nsyntactically opaque.  \\n\\nAn example of such a verbal adjective is given in (59a): as will be \\n\\ndemonstrated in the following sections with a number of examples, this lexical \\nderivate has an adjectival ‘long’ (complex) inflection in Czech and a stative \\ninterpretation. Another sign of its origin within the Lexicon is its possible semantic \\nopacity (semantic shift) with respect to the verbal stem.  \\n  \\n(59)  \\n\\n(a) \\n \\n \\n\\nPetr  je takový uzavře- n - ý \\nPeter is such   closed-ADJ-AGR \\n’Peter is introverted.‘ \\n\\n \\n \\nThe existence of categorially complex compounds inside the Lexicon is a non-\\ncontroversial aspect of our analysis; any theory must allow for such vocabulary.  \\n\\n4.4.3.2  Syntactic Derivate \\n\\nIf the head A0 joins the V0 in syntactic processing (before Spell Out), i.e. in  \\n\\nIn this paper, however, we claim that the adjectival morpheme, is not always an \\nautonomous semantic lexical item but can be a productive derivational morpheme \\nwith a specific interpretation (i.e. it is a member of the Czech Syntacticon). \\nConsequently it need not be combined with the verb inside the Lexicon, but it can \\nbecome the part of the structure V+A in (55) in some later level of a derivation.  \\n \\n(58B), the future [AV+A] complex first enters the derivation as a verbal head only, i.e. \\nthe initial Numeration contains only the V0, and the V0 realises its verbal \\nsubcategorisation in the initial level of derivation. It is only after the A0 is added that \\nthe complex becomes adjectival, and as an adjective it will both appear at PF and be \\ninterpreted at LF (with no idiosyncratic semantic features but with a categorial \\ncharacteristics of an adjective).  \\n \\nAn example of such a syntactic [AV+A] derivate illustrating a so called \\nadjectival passive is given in (59b). As illustrated and discussed in a number of \\nexamples in the following sections, this derivate shares most properties with (59a): it \\nhas a long inflection and preferably stative interpretation. Contrary to  (59a), however, \\na syntactic derivate can carry some Aspect, has a very regular form and is \\nsemantically transparent. \\n  \\n(59) \\n \\n \\n\\n(b)  \\n \\n \\n\\nPetr byl    (po)chvále-n-ý \\nPeter was praised-ADJ-AGR \\n‘Peter was praised.‘ \\n\\n4.4.3.3  Post-syntactic Derivate \\n\\nIt is the stative (adjectival) interpretation (with the lack of idiosyncratic semantic \\nfeatures) that signals the LF presence of the adjectival head A0 in the [AV+A] complex \\nin (55a/b). And it is this interpretation which is missing with the third kind of derivate, \\nin which the adjectival head A0 becomes a part of the complex as late as at the \\n\\n \\n\\n37 \\n\\n\\x0cauditory-perceptual interface (PF) i.e. in  (58C). In this case of a post-syntactic \\nderivation the verbal stem V0 enters the initial Numeration, selects verbal Arguments \\nand goes through the whole syntactic process retaining its verbal character. Because \\nthe adjectival head is not inserted before Spell Out, it is not interpreted at Logical \\nForm, so this interpretative interface analyses the V0 as its head. Therefore the post-\\nsyntactic derivate is able to refer to a verbal activity and carry aspectual features. In \\nthis case, the only level where the adjectival morpheme is present is the phonetic \\nlevel: its PF format is [AV+A] and includes the agreement morphology.  \\n\\nWe propose that a passive participle used to form an analytic verbal passive is \\n\\nthe best candidate for such a post-syntactic verbal adjective in Czech. (59c) shows a \\nform characterised by a systematic ‘passive’ verbal subcategorisation, transparent \\nmeaning including a possible Aspect, and a ‘short’ adjectival agreement morphology. \\n \\n(59)(c)  \\n \\n \\n\\nPetr   byl   chválí  - vá  - n  - Ø \\nPeter was  praised+ASP+ADJ+AGR \\n‘Peter was praised.’ \\n\\n \\nBecause the adjectival derivational morpheme -n- in (59c) enters the derivation only \\nat PF, it is analogous to an agreement ending, i.e. to inflection, and therefore the \\nverbal passive participle can be properly analysed as a part of the verbal categorial \\nparadigm.62  \\n\\n4.4.3.4  Co-indexation and Agreement \\n\\nThe order of morphemes in (55) reflects, according to the Mirror Principle (38b), the \\nhierarchy and ordering of the levels of the syntactic processing:  \\n \\n(60) \\n\\n(a) \\n\\n(b) \\n\\n(c) \\n\\nThe lexical stem (V) is an element taken from Lexicon and a part of the  \\ninitial Numeration set. \\nA derivational suffix (A) becomes the head of the V+A complex as \\nsoon as it enters the derivation and serves as head at LF. \\nAn agreement inflectional morpheme: Uninterpretable features (N) \\nenter the derivation at PF and have no influence on the syntactic \\ncategory of the complex.  \\n\\n \\nThe agreement morphemes exemplified in (55) and mentioned in (60c) reflect the Phi \\nfeatures of a nominal complex which occupies the position of structural subject of the \\npassive participle. In generative grammar such agreement morphology (with \\nparticiples) has been studied especially in e.g. French and Italian. Most cited is the \\nhypothesis presented in the study by Richard Kayne (1989), who claims that the \\nparticiple morphology is result of the relation between the participle and a nominal \\nelement which moves from the deep object position to a structural subject position. On \\nits way to the high periphery of an extended verbal projection this nominal element \\n\\n \\n                                                 \\n62   Contrary to the participial morphology, in the preceding sections we provided a number of \\n\\narguments showing that the AUX used to form the analytic passive cannot be taken as an \\nequivalent of inflection.. \\n\\n \\n\\n38 \\n\\n\\x0cgenerated as a right sister to V passes through the SPEC(V) (in Kayne’s work through \\nthe V-adjunct), and it is this SPEC-head relation which results in participial \\nagreement.63 \\n\\nWe accept the idea that the adjectival agreement signals a SPEC-head relation. \\n\\nContrary to Kayne’s original  proposal, however, we do not generate an object as a \\nright-hand sister to V, but, as illustrated in (36) we take the SPEC(V) position as the \\nbase position of the internal Argument. Therefore we propose that SPEC(V) and V is \\nthe structure in which the internal Argument (later on a structural subject of the \\npassive) and the participle enter the relation Agree.  \\n\\nIn the preceding sections we proposed that the agreement inflectional \\n\\nmorpheme is inserted into the structure late in the derivation at PF. The morpheme, \\nhowever, reflects a co-indexation which is established in the level of the derivation \\nwhen the elements sensitive to the agreement relation appear in each other’s checking \\ndomain. The element requiring the coindexation is the adjectival affix  (60b) which \\nhas to receive some Phi features. Therefore we assume that the coindexation takes \\nplace as soon as the adjectival affix enters the derivation, although the morphological \\nrealisation is always at PF.  \\n\\nIn the case of the lexical derived adjective demonstrated in (59a), the \\n\\ncoindexation takes place immediately after the initial Merge of the noun to the domain \\nof the [AV+A] head. The process of (i) abstract feature coindexation and (ii) \\nrealisation of agreement morphology is thus dissociated into two stages, and the \\nresulting morphology is agglutinating (more complex and always separable from the \\nadjectival suffix).  \\n\\nWith the syntactic derivates (59b), the co-indexation can take in a level of \\n\\nsyntactic processing, because in the initial Numeration the complex is syntactically \\ndefined as V. Still, even in this case the process of co-indexation is dissociated from \\nits morphological realisation and the resulting PF form is therefore again agglutinating \\n(what Czech grammar calls the complex/long agreement). \\n\\nWith post-syntactic adjectives, i.e. the true verbal passives demonstrated in \\n\\n(59c), the processes of co-indexation and morphological realisation take place on the \\nsame level: at PF. We propose that Czech’s short (simple/participial) agreement \\nmorphology signals this simultaneous abstract co-indexation and morphological \\nrealisation, i.e. these different morphological forms reveal a difference in derivational \\nhistory.64  \\n\\nIn the next sections we are going to demonstrate the phase-by-phase derivation of \\nthe Czech analytic passive with transitive and intransitive verbs, trying to predict their \\ndistribution based on the general syntactic principles developed up to this point.  \\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n                                                 \\n63   The structural SPEC-head relation for agreement morphology is also accepted in e.g. \\n\\nBorer & Wexler (1992). For an alternative see Claire Lefevbre (1988), who claims that the \\nagreement relation is defined under government, with the participles V being the \\ngoverning and the nominal element the governed element.  \\n\\n64   For the distinction between short and long morphology see section 7.1.1. \\n\\n \\n\\n39 \\n\\n\\x0c5  DERIVATION OF IMPERFECT PASSIVE PARTICIPLES  \\n\\nThe verbal passive participles (post-lexical verbal derivates) are formed from lexical \\nstems which are present in the initial Numeration in the same form as those resulting \\nin active verbal forms. In the following subsections we are going to describe in more \\ndetail the process of deriving the Czech analytic passive, proposing that it takes place \\nin several subsequent levels/phases as ordered below.   \\n \\n(61) \\n\\nInitial projection of the verbal head V, which is taken from the Lexicon  \\nand listed in the initial Numeration.

We are not going to try to solve this complex problem here and so \\nwill use only information/features relevant for our analysis.  \\n\\n66   For our purposes we will use here the simple categorial repertory based on the distinction \\n\\nbetween the [±N] and [±V] features; see Chomsky (1970). The category labels are in the \\nideal case based on semantic characteristics, but not only on that. For some more \\ndiscussion above see the introduction to section 4.4 and the footnote 55 of Part 1. \\n\\n67   For the notion of lexical case see footnote 38 of Part 1.  \\n68   Apart from (65), the lexical entry also contains the semantic features which will give it the \\n\\ncorrect interpretation at LF and the Czech phonetic feature format. \\n\\n \\n\\n41 \\n\\n\\x0cDP with the internal role of Recipient will have to be realised by a lexical (inherent) \\nCase.69 \\n \\n(66)  Syntactic subcategorisation  \\n\\nof nadrž-ov-/-u- (‘favour‘) \\n\\n \\n\\n(a) \\n(b) \\n\\n[+V][-N],  \\n(i)  Agent, Recipient,  \\n(ii) Dative \\n\\n \\nWith the inflecting open category of verbs in Czech the verbal stem is never realised \\nas bare.

Its verbal character is also reflected by its ability to carry a marked value of the \\nAspectual feature [±LS/A]. The verbal character of the passive participle is therefore \\nsupported by the presence of the features [+ACTIVITY] and [±LS/A],  which were \\nboth exemplified in (49) and (50) of Part 1. Another proof of the verbal character of \\nthe passive participle is the Theta Grid of the stem. Although it has a modified valency \\nwith respect to the active verbal form, it is clearly selecting arguments like a verb.  \\n\\nAssuming that the verbal stem V0 is listed in the initial Numeration and enters \\n\\nthe derivation, it projects according to universal phrasal projection rules and creates \\nthe position of SPEC(V), which is the position with the theta role of  Argument Θ2  \\n(the position where the relevant Argument is Merged).  The part of the transitive \\nverbal structure (projection of the lexical head V) introduced in (36) of Part 1 is \\nrepeated here as (67). \\n \\n(67)  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n        Vmax \\n     \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n  V0   \\nArgument Θ2     \\n    Pavel \\nchvál- \\n    Paul                        praise- \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n                                                 \\n69   For the purpose of our discussion we also assume that the lexical entries (65) and (66) are \\nmarked as [±LS/A], i.e. they are imperfective. The value of the [±LS/A] feature need not be \\nin fact specified for each lexical entry. In Czech, the value of [+LS/A] correlates with the \\nabsence of a verbal prefix, while the verbal prefixes usually mean [±LS/A]. Though the \\nsystem is clearly more complex than this, we believe that a complete study will allow one \\nto derive the feature of Aspect directly from independent factors, one being simply the \\ncategorial feature of V in (65a) and (66a).  \\n\\n \\n\\n42 \\n\\n\\x0c5.2  The Projection of the light verb v* \\n\\n5.2.1 Derivation of an active verbal form \\n\\nA complex verbal projection of a transitive verb also contains, apart from the head V,  \\na light verb head v*. It can moreover be c-commanded by a functional projection T, \\nthe presence of which is signalled by the presence of the feature [+Finit(ness)].

The verb být (‘be‘) \\nhas no thematic frame, and without a syntactic unification with the verbal head the \\nposition of v* is not able to transfer the Theta Roles of the verb V to the position \\nSPEC(v*). In other words, by filling the head v*  with an AUX být (‘be‘), the \\nArgument Θ1 present in the subcategorisation frame of the V cannot be realised in the \\nsame way as it is with the active verbal forms after v* incorporates the head V.  \\n \\nand Case assignment, we repeat here the modified scheme (69) as (72).  \\n \\n(72) \\n \\n \\n\\nTo illustrate the proposed properties of the structure with respect to Theta Role \\n\\n  v*max \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nSPEC(v*)           \\nArgument Θ1 \\n\\n   v*P \\n\\nv* \\n\\n                  V max \\n\\nSPEC(V) \\n\\n \\n        Argument Θ2 \\n\\n           V0  \\n\\n \\n\\n     Ø \\n    Ø \\n\\n     \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\nbýt  \\nbe  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n           V0                     \\n\\n Pavel   \\n \\n Paul \\n\\n        chvál-          \\n        praise \\n\\n \\n\\n44 \\n\\n\\x0cAs stated in (70b), a structural ACC is a result of the attraction V→v*, and \\n\\n \\nAlthough the verb být (‘be’) cannot project the Theta Role of Argument Θ1 into its \\nSPEC, the discussion in section 1.5 demonstrates that the passive AUX can fully \\nsatisfy the verbal features of the extended projection, including the checking of the \\n<+V> feature of the head T. This is an important condition for convergence of the \\nstructure because without this process the structure proposed in (72) cannot license \\nany Argument.   \\n \\ngiven that this movement does not take place in (72) , there is no ACC in the passive \\nstructure in (72).  \\nOn the other hand, following  (70a), it is the attraction of  v*→T  (signalled by \\n \\nfinite morphology) that licenses the structural NOM. Therefore NOM can be assigned \\nonly after the Merge of  the functional head T with features <+V> and <+D/N> . The \\nfeature <+V> on T attracts the v*→T movement, and because the Argument Θ2 in its \\nposition in SPEC(V) is in the checking domain of the head T, it can check the feature \\n<+D/N> of T and be marked by NOM.  \\n \\ntwo consequences of one cause.  The lack of Θ2 and of ACC  result from inserting \\ntwo separate elements into the complex structure of the transitive verb, i.e. into the \\ncomplex  [v*V+v*]. The insertion of an AUX in v* disallows incorporation of V into \\nv*, and  this results in (i) the impossibility of assigning Θ2 of V to SPEC(v*), and (ii) \\nthe impossibility of assigning ACC to SPEC(V) by means of  the ‘activated’ V.  \\n\\nAccording to our analysis Burzio’s Generalisation in (31) of Part 1 summarises \\n\\n5.2.3 A Comparison of the Active and Passive Projections \\n\\nAccording to (69), the structure of VP further projects by Merging of the head v* \\nwhich carries a feature <+V>. This feature must be checked, and the checking can be \\ndone in the two ways stated in (32) of Part 1 (i) In the active structures exemplified in \\n(69), the feature <+V> of v* is checked by a transformation Attract (32b) of Part 1, \\ni.e. by V→v*. The second way of checking the feature <+V> of v* takes place in \\npassive structures as in (72), where the feature is checked by Merge (32a) of Part 1, \\ni.e. by insertion of a separate element ( the verb být (‘be‘) into the position of v*. Once \\nthe feature is checked by Merge, the Attract transformation V→v* cannot take place \\nany more because it would be unmotivated.  \\n\\nWe assume that the need to realise the full Theta Grid (stated in the \\n\\nsubcategorisation of a specific verbal item) is optional, so that the initial semantic \\nNumeration does not have to include an item marked as an Argument with Θ1. If so, \\nthe active and passive projections are syntactically equivalent: they are able to check \\nthe relevant feature of v* either synthetically, by one complex verbal form [v*V+v*] or \\nanalytically, by two separate syntactic units v* and V.  \\n\\n5.3 \\n\\nInsertion of the Derivational Morpheme \\n\\nAccording to our analysis. as the last phase of the derivation of a verbal passive \\nclause, the verbal stem V is complemented by a derivational head of the category A \\n(the adjectival –n/-t suffix). At the phonological level this morpheme becomes the \\nhead of the structure [AV+A] and can be co-indexed with the trace of the Argument \\nΘ2, (tPaul) generated in SPEC(V) and attracted to SPEC(T). This modified scheme we \\n\\n \\n\\n45 \\n\\n\\x0cgive in (73); the solid arrow indicates attraction to SPEC(T) and the broken arrow the \\nagreement relation. \\n  \\n(73) \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n     (Vmax) Amax \\n     \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n   SPEC(T):  Pavel \\n\\n \\n\\n  SPEC(A) \\nArgument Θ2     \\n \\nPaul     \\n\\n    tPavel   \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n(V)AP \\n\\n  V0                 A0 \\nchvál-         -n+Ø/-n+a/-n+o  \\n    ADJ+AGR \\nprais-   \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\nThe suffix -n-/-t is of category Adjective, and as such it can (and in Czech must) be \\novertly marked for agreement.  The co-indexation of the A morpheme with the \\nnominal features in its checking domain (SPEC-head agreement) takes place in  (73), \\nand the resulting inflectional morphology reflects the Phi features of Gender/ Number/ \\nCase. Because the insertion of the agreement morphology takes place in the same \\nlevel as the co-indexation, the resulting adjectival morphology is of the ‘short’ type: -\\nn+Ø/-n+a/-n+o, or -t+Ø/-t+a/-t+o. The singular paradigm is exemplified in  (74). \\n \\n(74) \\n\\n \\n\\nchvále-n+Ø   / chvále-n+a  / chválen+o \\npraisedADJ+SM      /  praisedADJ+SF   / praisedADJ+SN \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nThe mutual compatibility of the derived adjective and a light verb v* is ensured \\n\\nby the subcategorisation of the verb být (‘be‘). As mentioned in (42c) in section 3.3 \\nthe verb být (‘be‘) selects non-verbal complements in the form of AP.70  \\n\\n5.4  The distinction between the Structural and Lexical Cases \\n\\nThe reason why the passive structure cannot license its internal Argument by \\n\\nACC is due to the nature of Accusative case. As stated in (70b), Accusative is a \\nstructural / configuration case  in Czech and is assigned to the position  SPEC(V) only \\nafter the transformation V→v* (which reflects/ indicates the transitivity of active \\nverbs). Lexical case, which the verb selects in its subcategorial frame, is assigned \\nimmediately after the Argument enters a derivation and is located in SPEC(V).71   \\nBecause the position of the non-Accusative Arguments is in SPEC(V), they \\n\\nshould be susceptible to being attracted by the strong feature <+D> of the finite head \\nT. However, their passivisation, i.e. movement to SPEC(T), is not possible, because \\noblique case we claim is a morphological realisation of an underlying PP structure \\n(the P is realised as bound case morpheme on its object, and as such is not able to \\n\\n \\n                                                 \\n70   More discussion about the verbs selecting passive participles see  7.1.6.  \\n71   The concept of structural versus lexical case is discussed in footnote 38 of Part 1. For \\n\\nSlavic languages this distinction is crucially utilised in e.g. Franks (1995) and Veselovská \\n(2001a). \\n\\n \\n\\n46 \\n\\n\\x0ccheck the <D> feature on T. Moreover, after a movement to SPEC(T), an Argument \\nmust be assigned structural nominative, and no DP can carry more than one case.  \\n\\nAs for the non-Accusative adjuncts to verbs which are generated in some \\n\\nposition other than SPEC(V), they can appear with passive participles. They keep their \\nform as well as their obligatory/ optional characteristics of complementation, as seen \\nin the following examples.  \\n \\n(75) \\n(a) \\n \\n\\n \\nPetr přemlouvá Pavla k odchodu  \\n  \\uf0de Pavel je přemlouván k odchodu \\nPeterNOM convinces PaulACC for leave \\uf0de PaulNOM is convinced for leave \\n‘Peter is convincing Paul to leave.‘         ‘Paul is being convinced to leave.‘  \\n\\nPetr         přemlouvá *Ø / Pavla  \\nPeterNOM convinces   *Ø / PaulACC \\n‘Peter convinces *Ø / Paul.‘   \\n\\n  \\uf0de Pavel  je přemlouván *Ø / k odchodu  \\n  \\uf0de PaulNOM is convinced *Ø / for leave \\n      ‘Paul is convinced *Ø / to leave.‘ \\n\\n(b) \\n \\n \\n \\n\\nConsider also  the sentences in (76) which illustrate a regular Czech verb \\n\\nselecting a direct object ACC and an indirect object DAT. As expected, in (76b) ACC \\ncan be passivised (with the DAT unchanged) while in (76c) the DAT cannot be, nor is \\nit possible to form an impersonal passive in (76d). \\n \\n(76)  Petr         slibuje      všem děvčatům velkou pusu  \\nPeterNOM promises all     girlsDAT    big      kissACC \\n‚Peter is promising a big kiss to the girls.‘ \\n\\n \\n\\n(a)  \\uf0de Velká pusa  je slibována všem děvčatům.  \\n\\n     big kissNOM is promised all girlsDAT  \\n\\n(b)  \\uf0de * Všechna děvčata jsou slibována velkou pusu. \\n\\n                            *  all          girlsNOM are  promised big      kissACC \\n\\n(c)  \\uf0de  * je  pro  slibováno       všem děvčatům velkou pusu \\n\\n      * is  pro  promised3SN all      girlsDAT   big      kissACC \\n\\n \\nOn the other hand, no matter how its exact analysis would look, the Accusative in (77) \\nis not assigned by the verb but is rather the so called “adverbial Accusative”(NP \\nadverb) used for Czech temporal adverbials. This adjunct ACC cannot be passivised \\nas (77b) demonstrates. The selected complement of the verb in (77) is the DAT, which \\ncannot be passivised either in (77c). An impersonal passive structure is nonetheless \\npossible, as seen in (77d) with both the DAT and non-verbal ACC adjunct unchanged. \\n \\n(77)  Petr         nadržuje   děvčatům celou dobu  \\nPeterNOM favours girlsDAT    all       timeACC  \\n‘Peter is favouring the girls all the time.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n(a)  \\uf0de * Celá doba       je nadržována děvčatům.  \\n\\n        all     timeNOM  is  favoured     girlsDAT  \\n\\n(b)  \\uf0de * Děvčata jsou nadržována celou dobu . \\n                            *  girlsNOM are  favoured     all      timeACC \\n\\n \\n\\n47 \\n\\n\\x0c-  Who did it?‘ \\n\\n(c)  \\uf0de  Je  pro  nadržováno děvčatům celou dobu. \\nis  pro  favours3SN girlsDAT  all      timeACC \\n‘The girls are favoured all the time.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n5.5 \\n\\n  Formal and Logical Presence of the Theta Role Θ1-Agent \\n\\nIn the analytic passive structures derived from transitive verbs the position of Theta \\nRole Θ1-Agent cannot be assigned because the head of the light verb v* does not \\nincorporate the Theta Frame of the lower V: the insertion of the verb být (‘be‘) in the \\nv* head blocks the attraction V→v*. As for interpretation, however, the following \\ncomparison with the reflexive passive shows that the possibility of an Agent is not \\nlost, in spite of the fact that the Argument Θ1 cannot be realised as NOM.  \\n \\n(78)  A:  \\n \\n      \\n\\nKdo to udělal? \\nwho it did \\n\\nTo okno       bylo rozbito  včera.  \\n \\nthe window was  broken yesterday \\n \\n‘The window was broken yesterday.’ \\n\\nB:  \\n- \\n\\n \\n(79)  A:   \\n \\n\\n    \\n\\n \\nTo okno       se       rozbilo  včera. \\nthe window REFL broke   yesterday  \\n‘The window broke yesterday.’  \\n \\n\\nB:  \\n- \\n- \\n\\n*Kdo to udělal? \\n*who it did \\n*’Who did it?’  \\n\\n \\nThe presence of a logical subject is also revealed by the possible use of an intentional \\nadverbial which implies an agent of the activity (e.g. schválně/ úmyslně‚ intentionally/ \\non purpose‘). \\n \\n(80) \\n \\n\\nSchůze         byla schválně      / úmyslně   rozpuštěna (předsedou)  \\nmeetingNOM was  intentionally/purposely dissolved    (chairman3SN ) \\n‘The meeting was dissolved intentionally/on purpose (by a chairman).’  \\n(The chairman did it intentionally/on purpose.) \\n\\nThe implicit presence of a logical Agent (Argument Θ1) in such sentences in fact \\nsupports our analysis. If the passive participle is a post-syntactic [AV+A] derivate, it \\nenters the logical interface as a verb, and the adjectival suffix is present only at PF. In \\nthis situation, though it cannot be present with overt NOM case, the LF interface \\nforces some interpretation of Argument Θ1 from the Theta Frame of the verb. \\n\\n5.5.1 Agent in the Instrumental Case \\n\\nThe interpretation of Argument Θ1 is possible at LF although the passive structure is \\nnot able to license more than one Argument at the syntactic level (the non-case \\nmarked internal Argument is assigned NOM after the attraction v*→T).  With NOM \\nnot available, the Thematic Role of Agent can be phonetically realised only as an \\nadjunct, i.e. it gets Case from some independent source. In Czech, as in other \\nlanguages, at least some of the passive structures can express the Agent in the form of \\n[DP, INST] or a full PP A number of theories reflect the fact that the INSTR DP \\nshows many characteristics of a semantic Argument of the passive verb, e.g. a detailed \\nstudy by Jane Grimshaw (1990: 109/132), who labels this instrumental DP an A-\\nadjunct (i.e. an Argument Adjunct).  \\n\\n \\n\\n48 \\n\\n\\x0cSeveral theories also try to explain the choice / form of such an A-adjunct as \\n\\ninstrumental. The classical proposal made by Fillmore (1968) argues that the \\ninstrumental Agents have a PP structure. We accept this solution, claiming that \\nmorphological INSTR in Czech is (like any other oblique case) a bound morpheme \\nrealising an empty preposition, i.e. here DPINSTR has a PP structure. Instrumental is a \\nmorphological case which inherently expresses a range of meanings and does not \\nexclude the role of the active Argument Θ1. Apart from instrumental this \\ninterpretation is possible with (only) overt PPs, one of which is exemplified in (81) \\nbelow. (81b) demonstrates in addition that the presence of INSTR does not depend on \\nthe feature/presence of T.72 \\n \\n(81) \\n \\n\\nPetremINSTR  \\nPeterINSTR \\n\\n(a) \\n \\n\\nPavel je  chválen  \\nPaul is praised  \\n‘Paul is praised by Peter.‘ \\n\\n/ \\n/ \\n\\nod Petra \\nby Peter \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n(b)  \\n \\n\\nbýt chválen \\n \\nto be praised    \\n‘to be praised by Peter.‘ \\n\\n někýmINSTR \\nPeterINSTR \\n\\n/ \\n/ \\n\\nod Petra \\nby Peter \\n\\n \\nIn this study we accept the PP (adjunct) analysis of the Czech instrumental. We \\nassume that adjuncts are optional, which makes them distinct from the obligatory \\narguments.  \\n\\nThe following examples at first seem to argue against the non-obligatory \\n\\nnature of instrumental Agents. 73  \\n \\n(82)  Ten dům          byl projektován  *Ø / francouzským architektem \\n \\n\\nthe  houseNOM was designed      *Ø / French           architectINSTR  \\n‘The house was designed by a French architect.’ \\n\\n \\n                                                 \\n72   Fillmore (1968) proposes that the (optional) Agent interpretation is a result of the nature \\nof the preposition used. The same role could be attributed to the Czech bound inflectional \\nmorpheme of the instrumental case.  This case would then be in Czech interpreted in the \\nsame way as (i) Agent (on a par with NOM) or (ii) Instrument (alternating with an overt \\npreposition). \\n\\n73   The Theta Roles of passive participles are compared with active verbs with a focus on the \\n\\npresence of a logical Agent in Chomsky (1965, Chapter 2), Wasow (1977, section 4.3), \\nJaeggli (1986, section 6), Afarli (1989, Chapter 1.2) and Schoorlemmer (1995, Chapter 3). \\nIn the following section 5.5.1 we discuss the interpretation of the instrumental Agents, \\nconceiving of it as optional. This is in accord with the typological generalisation presented \\nin Keenan (1985: 247), who claims that many languages have optional Agents with \\npassives but that no attested language has obligatory Agents with passives. Štícha (1984: \\n96) has collected statistical data showing that in languages which allow Agents of passives \\nthe majority of passives are still without Agents. The proportion of passives with Agents \\ncan also be influenced by the word order in a given language: in languages with a fixed \\nconstituent order (like English) the number of passives with sentence final (rhematised) \\nby-Agents is going to be much higher than in languages which can rhematise the Agent \\npostverbally without passivisation (like Czech).  \\n\\n \\n\\n49 \\n\\n\\x0cWe want to argue that the above example is not ungrammatical due to the INSTR \\nbeing missing. Rather, the structure is not salient because its informational value is too \\npoor. Its predicate does not bring any new (rhematic) information which would not be \\npresent already in the meaning of the structural subject. As illustrated in  (83), if some \\nother new information is added which can fill the information gap (by taking the role \\nof contrastive rheme), the sentence becomes grammatical although still missing the \\nINSTR. \\n \\n(83) \\n \\n\\nTen dům  byl   projektován a    ne  postaven jen tak spontánně.  \\nthe house was designed     and not built       only spontaneously \\n‘That house was designed and not just built in some spontaneous way.’ \\n\\n(a) \\n \\n\\n (b) \\n\\n(c) \\n\\nPrávě proto, že     ten dům    byl projektován, řada jeho vlastností je nezvyklá. \\njust because (that) the house was projected   number its  properties is unusual  \\n‘It is because the house has been designed, that a number of its properties are  \\nunusual.’ \\n\\nTen dům byl projektován včera       / dva roky        / velmi zodpovědně \\nthe house was projected  yesterday / for two years / very responsibly \\n‘The house was (being) designed yesterday / for two years / with a high  \\nresponsibility.’  \\n\\nNo claim for obligatory A-Adjuncts can be supported by (84) either, because the \\nINSTR in (84) is neither obligatory nor interpreted as the instrumental Agent. \\n \\n(84) \\n\\n(a) \\n\\nNáhrdelník je vykládán *Ø / diamanty \\nnecklace    is  inlaid      *Ø / diamondsINSTR \\n‘The necklace is inlaid with diamonds.’ \\n\\n \\nThe INSTR in (84a) is a lexical/ oblique case appearing with the Czech verb vyklád- \\n‘inlay‘ to carry another standard semantic role of INSTR, i.e. that of a complement \\nwhich expresses the Instrument. The following example (84b) demonstrates that an \\n(optional) AgentINSTR can in fact co-occur with this INSTR complement. The \\nungrammaticality of (84a) is therefore caused by the lack of the obligatory Argument \\n(InstrumentINSTR) of the verb and not by the lack of AgentINSTR. \\n \\n(84) \\n\\n(b)   Náhrdelník je (právě) klenotníkem    vykládán brilianty. \\n\\nnecklace      is  (just)    goldsmithINSTR inlaid      diamondsINSTR \\n‘The necklace is just being inlaid by a goldsmith with diamonds.‘ \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nWe have no ambition to define here an exact general process of interpretation for \\nverbal Arguments. But we still want to bring attention to the fact that in Czech the \\norder of the instrumental DP seems to play a role in the interpretation of a passive \\nclause. In other words, the position of the Instrumental Adjunct with respect to the VP \\nprojection seems to be relevant, as seen in the following example. (85) suggests that \\nthe unmarked (most likely) interpretation requires an Agent reading for the DP which \\n\\n \\n\\n50 \\n\\n\\x0cis adjacent to the past participle.74 The same interpretation is more problematic with \\nthe inverted order. \\n  \\n(85)    (a) \\n\\nDopis byl  psán    Petrem      perem.  \\nletter  was written PeterINSTR penINSTR. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n(b) \\n\\n‘The letter was written by Peter with a pen.‘ \\n\\n??Dopis byl psán     peremINSTR PetremINSTR. \\n??letter was written penINSTR     PeterINSTR. \\n \\n\\n \\nWe therefore suggest that the Agent interpretation is analysed late at the interpretative \\ninterface (LF), and that the top Argument Θ1 interpretation is assigned to the closest \\nc-commanding NP/DP, if present and compatible with such an interpretation.  The \\nInstrumental PP may than get the Agent interpretation due to its proximity to the VP \\ndomain.  \\n\\n6  EXTERNAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE PASSIVE PARTICIPLE \\n\\nWe have argued that the form of the components of the analytic passive in Czech is \\nbasically the result of the need to check the feature <+V> of the head v*. This triggers \\nthe insertion of the verb být (‘be‘) into the position of v*. The form of the passive also \\ndepends on the need to realise the Theta Grid of the active verb. An active transitive \\nverb which is realised in a synthetic way by one complex  [v*V+v*] can license its \\ninternal argument, and the Merge of this single complex with T allows overt \\nrealisation of the NOM subject (external argument), too.  \\n \\nseparately. But on the other hand, the new derivate constructed from V of the category \\nA is [+N], and as such it can be licensed by an agreement with the Phi features of \\nsome related nominal head. The initial step in our analysis is based on the above \\nassumption. We claim that the external distribution of the passive participles follows \\nfrom the need to license (i) the [+N] participle and (ii) the arguments which have been \\ngenerated in the initial level as complements of the V head.  \\n\\nThis ability is lost in passives because the two heads V and v* are filled \\n\\nThe variety of distribution of the passive participle in Czech is illustrated in \\n\\n(86). The list demonstrates the passive participle as a part of (a/b) the \\nanalytic/impersonal passive with the AUX být (‘be‘), (c) the non-paradigmatic perfect \\nwith mít (‘have’) ‘have’), (d) an adjunct-complement. \\n \\n(86) \\n \\n\\nPaulNOM  is praised   PeterINSTR   (‘Paul is praised by Peter.‘) \\n\\nPavel      je chválen Petrem \\n\\n(a)  \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n(b) \\n \\n\\n(c) \\n \\n\\nJe nadržováno děvčatům. \\npro is favoured girlsDAT   (‘Girls are favoured.‘)  \\n\\nPavel     má odměnu     slíbenou. \\nPaulNOM has rewardACC promised \\n\\n(‘Paul was promised a reward.‘) \\n\\n \\n                                                 \\n74   See also example (84b) above. \\n\\n \\n\\n51 \\n\\n\\x0c(d) \\n\\nChválen Petrem,  Pavel     se       nadýmal       pýchou. \\npraised PeterINSTR PaulNOM REFL burst prideINSTR \\n ‘Praised by Peter, Paul was bursting with pride.‘ \\n\\n \\nIn the following subsections we will address the derivations of (86a/b/c). The structure \\nof the adjunct-complement in (86d) we leave for future research. \\n\\n6.1  Overview of Analytic Passives  \\n\\nThe following sections are going to briefly repeat the derivations of the Czech analytic \\npassive, discussing in more detail the system of how the structures and its components \\nconverge. \\n\\n6.1.1 Generating the Verbal Head and Argument Θ2  \\n\\nLet’s start with the analysis of the Czech analytic passive (86a) repeated in the \\nfollowing example. \\n \\n(87) \\n \\n \\n\\n(a)  \\n \\n            ’Paul is praised by Peter.’ \\n\\nPavel      je chválen Petrem \\nPaulNOM  is praised   PeterINSTR    \\n\\n  \\n \\n \\n\\nŽeny             jsou chváleny Petrem \\nWomenNOM  are   praised    PeterINSTR    \\n\\n(b)  \\n \\n           ’Women are praised by Peter.’ \\n\\n  \\nIn (71) and (73) we proposed a subcategorisation of the verb chválit’praise’: V, [__D], \\n<Θ1, Θ2>. In the first stage of derivation (the projection of the lexical V head) the \\nArguments Θ1 / Θ2 can project only partially: namely, the Θ2 (Pavel/ženy \\n’Paul/women’) is generated in the SPEC(V). After the Merge of v* with a strong \\n<+V> feature in (72) the feature of v* is checked by inserting the light verb být (’be’). \\nBecause the attraction of V→v* does not take place, (i) the structure loses the ability \\nto assign a structural Accusative in SPEC(V).  Moreover (ii), a separate light verb v* \\ncan not incorporate the Theta Grid of V to license the Argument Θ1 of V in its \\nSPEC(v*).  On the other hand, the verb být (’be’) in v* can carry the ‘verbal finite’ \\nfeatures of [TENSE], [MOD)], [ITER] and check the feature <+V> of the head T to \\nlicense the Argument Θ2 as Nominative.  \\n\\nThese initial levels of the process were illustrated in (72) and (73). The \\n\\nresulting structure is shown in the schematic (88). The co-indexed traces tx reflect the \\nprevious stages of the derivation: the broken arrow the (phrasal NP) movement of the \\nnominal Argument from SPEC(V) to SPEC(v*) and  SPEC(T), and the full arrow the \\n(head) movement of the light verb v* to T.  \\n \\n(88) \\n \\n\\n        Pavel                    je                                chvál-en \\n       Ženy.                    jsou                            chvále-n-y \\n\\n(a) \\n(b) \\n\\n \\n\\n[TP {PaulMS.NOM}i        {is3S }  [vP tv  [VP ti praisedADJ+MS.NOM] \\n[TP {womenFP.NOM}i. {are3P} [vP tv  [VP ti praisedADJ+ FP.NOM] \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n52 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n6.1.1. Licensing of the adjectival derivates  \\n\\nA participle is an adjectival category and as such it is licensed in Czech by an \\nadjectival agreement. As described in 4.4.3.4 in Part 1, we take it that the agreement \\nmorphology signals a syntactic relation to an A head with some nominal features. \\nAssuming that the SPEC-head relation is the prototypical agreement relation, the \\nadjectival head (suffix) in the [AV+A] complex can enter an agreement relation with \\nthe Phi features of the structural object, i.e. Argument Θ2, generated in SPEC(V/A).   \\nAs for the feature content of the agreement, some of them are integral parts of \\n\\nthe nominal constituent Θ2, e.g. Gender, while others are acquired by the nominal \\ncomplex in some later stage of derivation, e.g. Case. Therefore we conclude that the \\nagreement consists of both (i) a process of co-indexation which relates the two heads \\nwhen the agree relation holds, and (ii) a realisation of the features of the co-indexed \\nnominal complex on the adjectival head A (in the form of inflectional morphology}. \\n\\nBecause–contrary to lexical adjectives—the passive participle is a post-\\n\\nsyntactic adjectival derivate [AV+A], the adjectival head A comes to be coindexed \\nwith the nominal element at some later stage of the derivation. We proposed that for \\nthe Czech analytic passive with a “short agreement” ending it is as late as at PF. This \\nlate co-indexation seems to result in a restricted case paradigm with passive \\nparticiples. In Czech they can morphologically express all three genders (M/F/N) and \\nboth numbers (S/P). As for Case, however, they appear only with structural Cases. In  \\n(86a) we demonstrated a Nominative in an analytic passive. For the paradigm, \\nstructure and more discussion of the Accusative forms in Czech see section 6.3 below. \\n\\nIn (89) we illustrate the SPEC – head relation which results in adjective \\n\\nagreement morphology. We demonstrate the distinction between lexical adjectival \\nmodifiers and passive participles (i.e. syntactic and post-syntactic derivates). The \\nscheme in (89a) shows a structure of a nominal head N with an adjectival AP in the \\nposition of (multiple) SPEC(N). The scheme in  (89b) shows a passive participle in \\nthe structure proposed in (73), i.e. as an adjectival derivate with a nominal constituent \\nin its SPEC(A). Notice that the categorial labels of the resulting constituents are \\ndistinct: (89a) is a nominal projection Nmax, while (89b) is a projection of Amax. \\n \\n(89)  (a)   nominal phrase with  \\n \\n   an AP premodifier    \\n \\n \\n\\n(b) passive participle with  \\n     Argument Θ2 \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n      Nmax \\n      \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nV/Amax \\n\\n \\n  \\n\\n    Amax     \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n[AV+A0] \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n          N/NP                       Nmax  \\n \\n\\n        \\n\\n     \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n    V/AP \\n\\n \\n\\n              N0 \\n\\n \\n\\n          N0 \\n\\n    \\n\\n [AV+A0] \\n\\n    \\n chvále-n(-ý)                       Pavel \\npraisedADJ+MS.NOM.long         PaulMS.NOM \\n\\n \\n\\n    Pavel \\n    PaulMS.NOM        praisedADJ+MS.NOM.short \\n\\n            chvále-n-Ø  \\n\\n \\n\\n53 \\n\\n\\x0c \\nWe assume that the category A (adjective) has a strong <+N> feature which must be \\nchecked by some N head. This occurs in Czech via coindexation, which is, at PF, \\nmorphologically realised as overt adjectival agreement inflection. For the \\ncoindexation heads N and A must enter the relation Agree, i.e. they must be in a \\nchecking domain of each other. This holds for both structures in (89a/b), and therefore \\nboth of them can be co-indexed and both the structures converge. 75  \\n\\nThe distinction between (89a/b), however becomes more significant if and when \\n\\nthe nominal complex Nmax bears an oblique case. This distinction supports our \\nanalysis which postulates a PP structure for oblique cases. If the nominal complex \\nNmax in (89a) is in an oblique case, i.e. is c-commanded by a preposition, the presence \\nof such a P has no  influence to the relation between the N and A heads:  they remain \\nin a mutual checking domain. Therefore the structural vs. oblique case distinction \\nplays no role with the morphology of adjectival modifiers in (89a); Czech lexical \\nadjectives can agree with the noun they modify in all Czech cases.76  \\n\\nWe get a different consequence in (89b) ), however, if the Nmax in the SPEC(A) \\ncarries some oblique case, i.e. if it is a PP. 77  If this Nmax is indeed Pmax , the head of \\nthe complex is in fact a preposition P, and the presence of such a head preposition \\n(although it is in Czech often phonologically realised only as a bound morpheme on \\nthe nominal head) prevents an Agree (checking) relation between the N and A heads.78 \\nThe adjectival head in this situation is not able to check its <+N> feature (with the Phi \\nfeatures of a coindexed N) and the structure does not converge.79 \\n\\nThe paradigm of Czech agreement morphology contains features of \\n\\nGender/Number fused with Case, and this is the reason why the structures of type \\n(89b) can appear only in positions which are marked by a structural case. With \\nAccusative (??), the case becomes a part of the Phi feature cluster which the participle \\nreceives in the V -  SPEC(V) relation. As stated in (70a) and  illustrated in (72) , \\nstructural Nominative is the result of the relation of the Argument Θ2 to the finite \\n\\n \\n                                                 \\n75   In (89b) the constituent is labelled as V/AP to signal that the complex head of a post-\\n\\nsyntactic derivate [AV+A] passes through the initial and syntactic phases of derivation as a \\nVerb. This also explains the interpretation of the Argument in its SPEC as a direct object.  \\n\\n76   For examples and some more discussion of lexical attributive adjectives as in (89a) see \\n\\nalso section 7.3 below. \\n\\n77 This happens if the verb subcategorises for an Argument with a lexical/oblique case. The \\n\\nlexical case (i.e. the P) is then present in the structure from the beginning of the derivation, \\nalthough it does not get realised in its canonical position of a head P at PF but, instead, as \\na bound inflectional morpheme at N. \\n\\n78   Oblique case assignment is a relation between the V and P heads. The P interferes with the \\n\\nAgree relation of N (which is inside the PP) and A, which becomes a head of the [AV+A] \\ncomplex after the oblique case (P) is assigned.  \\n\\n79  Moreover, for some reason in the Accusative (the paradigm is illustrated in (94) below), \\n\\nthe combination of [+Masculine, +Human] does not have verbal (short) participial  \\nmorphology but always requires the adjectival (long)  version.  \\n(i)  Petr    už         má *slíben-a / slíben-ého   pejska. \\n\\nPeter already has promised MS/ACC*short/long. a doggieMS+HUM/ACC. \\nPeter has already been promised a doggie.‘ \\n\\n54 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0cAUX být (’be’) after it moves from v* to T , i.e. the Nominative case becomes a part \\nof the cluster after the Argument Θ2 moves into the position of a structural subject, \\ni.e. to SPEC(T). \\n\\n6.2. \\n\\nImpersonal Passives  \\n\\nIn the introductory section in the structures (7) and (8) of Part 1, we demonstrated that \\nCzech also allows so-called impersonal passives with intransitive verbs. We repeat \\nthose examples in (90), together with the agreement features and an impersonal \\nsubject marked as pro3SN. \\n \\n(90) \\n\\n(a)   \\n\\npro    Je    nadržováno děvčatům (učitelem) \\npro3SN is3S favoured3SN girlsDAT     (teacherINSTR) \\n‘Girls are favoured (by the teacher).’ \\n\\n \\n\\n(b)  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\npro     Je   hlasováno  o       stanovách     (členy). \\npro3SN is3S voted3SN    about statutesLOC  (membersINSTR) \\n‘The statutes are  voted about (by the members).’ \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nWe demonstrated that this kind of impersonal passive requires in Czech a verb which \\nsubcategorises for an internal Argument with an oblique case, i.e. which selects non-\\nAccusative complements (of the PP or NPGEN/DAT/INSTR type). The oblique case (in the \\nform of PP) is assigned to Argument Θ2 immediately after this argument Merges in \\nthe SPEC(V) of its subcategorising verb. For example, the verbal stem nadrž-ov-/-u- \\n(‘favour‘) selects the Argument Θ2 [+Dat]. Because this [+Dat] selection is a part of \\nthe lexical entry (it is an inherent part of the V stem entering the Numeration), it \\ncannot be changed during the process of derivation.  \\n\\nIn the next level the v*P Merges with the functional projection T, which has a \\n\\nstrong feature <+V> and carries [TENSE], [MOD] and [ITER] features. Apart from \\n(or because of) that, the head T assigns a structural Nominative. The examples in (90) \\nhave an impersonal, non-referential expletive pro3SN, in SPEC(T) and  thus conform to \\nthe descriptive validity of the Extended Projection Principle (see Chomsky, 1981, \\nChapter 3), requiring the presence of a structural subject in a clause. In Minimalism, \\nthe EPP can be reformulated as a non-interpretable case feature <+D/N> of a finite \\nfunctional head T, which has to be checked by a DP. This feature must be checked \\neven if the insertion/Merge of a grammatical verb such as být (’be’) in the head v* \\ndisallows the attraction V→v* and therefore the projection of Argument Θ1 in \\nSPEC(v*). In this case the strong feature <+D/N> of T can only be checked by \\nArgument Θ2, generated in SPEC(V), which must move to the position of a structural \\nsubject in SPEC(T). \\n\\nRecall, however, that in the examples (90) above the non-Accusative \\n\\nArgument Θ2 is a PP and hence cannot check a  <+D/N> feature. The SPEC position \\ntherefore must be occupied by an expletive pro3SN  if such an expletive is in the \\nrepertory of a given language (a part of its Syntacticon). Such an expletive triggers the \\ndefault agreement .3SN on the finite AUX, as exemplified on (90).  \\n \\nalso have a default agreement, as in (91a); in (91b) it agrees with the Argument Θ2 \\nPavlovi (’PaulSM.DAT’) and the result is not acceptable. The non-grammatical (91c) \\nshows clearly that Argument Θ2 with a lexical (subcategorised) Dative cannot enter \\n\\nAs for this default agreement, the following data shows that the participle must \\n\\n \\n\\n55 \\n\\n\\x0can agreement relation with the participle (the oblique Dative cannot be rewritten by a \\nstructural Nominative and the oblique Argument Θ2 cannot become a subject). We \\npropose that this is because such an Argument is a PP. \\n \\n(91) \\n \\n\\n Je   nadržováno        Pavlovi/ženám  \\npro3SN is3S favoured3SN.NOM Paul/womenSM/FM.DAT \\n‘Paul/Women are favoured.’ \\n\\n(a) \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n(b) \\n \\n\\n*Je    nadržovanému   Pavlovi  \\npro3SN  is3S favoured3SM.DAT  PaulDAT \\n\\n(c) \\n \\n\\n*Pavel        je    nadržován/-o.  \\n*PaulNOM  is3S favoured3SM/N.NOM \\n\\n \\n \\nThe ungrammaticality of (91d) shows that regardless of agreement, the structure \\ncannot license some other Argument Θ1 (e.g. Petr) with a Nominative. The only \\npossibility for introducing an Agent interpretation is demonstrated in (91e), where an \\nAgent interpretation can be assigned (at the level of Logical Form) to an Instrumental \\nDP or PP; see also section 5.5.1.  \\n \\n(91) \\n\\n (d) \\n\\n*Petr         je nadržován/-o Pavlovi. \\n*PeterNOM is favoured/-o PavloviDAT \\n\\n(e) \\n\\n Je nadržováno Pavlovi Petrem          / od Petra. \\npro3SN is favoured      Paul DAT PetrmINSTR / from Peter \\n‘Paul is favoured by Peter.' \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nWe propose that the participle is co-indexed with the default pro3SN because the \\n\\nA suffix on the participle must check its feature <+N> with some Phi features. The \\noblique PP is not a possible target for the Agree, so pro3SN is the next closest \\ncandidate, provided it is inside the checking domain of the A head.  \\n\\nWith our analysis the default agreement on the AUX is unproblematic because \\npro will appear in the SPEC-head relation with respect to the AUX (in v* or T). The \\nnature of the default agreement on the participle, however, is not so clear, because the \\ndistance between the [AV+A] complex in V and pro in SPEC(v*) is too far. The \\nexplanation for this long-distance agreement is suggested by the example (90), which \\nindicates that the impersonal passive requires a post-syntactic derivate with short \\nagreement morphology.80 \\n \\n(92) \\n\\n(a) \\n\\nJe    nadržováno / *-ané  děvčatům    \\npro3SN  is3S favoured3SN.sh ort/*long    girlsDAT          \\n‘Girls are favoured.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n(b) \\n\\n \\n\\nJe  hlasováno / *-ané  o       stanovách  \\npro3SN  is3S voted3SN short/*long  about statusesLOC \\n‘The statutes are  voted about.’  \\n\\n \\n                                                 \\n80   For more details see the discussion in section 7.1.1. \\n\\n \\n\\n56 \\n\\n\\x0c \\nAlthough in this paper we did not show many distinctions between the copula and the \\npassive AUX, there should be some, given that the former is plausibly V and the latter \\na light verb v*. As a light verb v*, the passive AUX may be missing in the initial \\n(lexical semantic) level of the Numeration, which would make possible a relation \\nbetween SPEC(v*) and V in (69).  \\n\\n6.3. \\n\\nAccusative Passive Participles   \\n\\nIn (86c) we exemplified the passive participle used in Czech in combination with the \\nverb mít (‘have’). We repeat the example below in (93) with more detailed description \\nof the feature distribution.81 \\n  \\n(93)  Pavel           má     slíbenou.             odměnu \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nPaulMS.NOM  has3S  promisedFS.ACC  rewardFS.ACC \\n’Paul was promised a reward.’ \\n\\n \\nThe table (94) below illustrates the Czech paradigm of the passive participle in the \\nAccusative, which is used with the verb mít (’have’). Notice that it has specific forms \\nfor Gender and Number. Thus with the exception of Case, which is restricted to \\nAccusative, this participle has a paradigm comparable to that of the Czech (gender-\\nmarked) adjectives. \\n \\n(94) \\n\\n’Peter was promised a trip /a reward / a bike / trips / rewards / bikes.’ \\n\\nPetr             má \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nPeterMS.NOM hasMS \\n\\n \\n(a)   slíbe-n-Ø      zájezd   \\n(b)  slíbe-n-ou  odměnu \\n(c)  slíbe-n-o     kolo  \\n \\nzájezdy \\n(d)  slíbe-n-é \\nodměny \\n(e)  slíbe-n-é \\nkola \\n(f)  slíbe-n-á \\n \\npromised \\n \\n\\nM[-HUM]S/ACC \\n\\n(‘trip) \\n(’reward’)  FS/ACC \\n(’bike’)  \\nNS/ACC \\n(’trips’)  MP/ACC \\n(’rewards’)  FP/ACC \\n(‘bikes’)   NP/ACC \\n    \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nThe following scheme (95) illustrates the derivation we propose for Czech Accusative \\npassive participles. Notice, that it differs from the analysis proposed for the analytic \\n\\n \\n                                                 \\n81   In (93) we are giving only the interpretation which takes the surface subject for an \\n\\nArgument of the past participle. In the Czech structure, however, the subject ‘Paul’ has no \\nor an unclear theta role with respect to the verbal stem of the derived adjective. The \\nsentence in (93) can be interpreted as: ‘Paul has a promised reward’ or ‘Paul has been \\npromised a reward’.   \\n We assume similar Numeration sets for those structures which differ with respect to the \\nchoice of alternatives during the process of derivation, i.e. given the repertory of lexical \\nand grammatical entries in a given language, the Merging of which can provide \\nalternatives to Move/Attract Transformation. We are not going to further discuss these \\nstructures here, however. \\n\\n57 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0cpassive in (72)/(73)/(88) above only by the kind of AUX used. The verb mít (‘have‘) \\nis a transitive verb [v*V+v*], i.e. according to (69) it has a more layered structure than \\nthe non-thematic unAccusative verb být (‘be‘).  In (95) the verb mít (‘have‘) is \\ngenerated as a lexical V1 with Argument Θ2 in its SPEC(V1).  \\n\\nIn (95) the Argument Θ2  of V1 in SPEC(V1) is the projection of the past \\n\\n   Tmax \\n\\nparticiple. The past participle enters the derivation as a verbal head (V2) and therefore \\nit projects its own Argument Θ2 in SPEC(V2).82 \\n \\n(95) \\n \\n \\nSPEC(T) \\n \\n \\n       V1+v*+T  \\n\\n       v*max \\n\\n      TP \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n       SPEC(v*) \\n   Argument Θ1    \\n\\n           v*P \\n\\n \\n\\n                tv* \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n                          V1max \\n\\n         \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n                                   SPEC(V1)  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nArgument Θ2ACC    \\nV2 /A max\\n\\n            \\n\\n                             \\n\\nV20 / A0 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n    SPEC(V2)   \\n   Argument Θ2 \\n     \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n       V20                   A0 \\n\\n   tV-1 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nPetr     má           tPetr      tmá        odměnuFS.ACC      slíbe-            -nouFS.ACC            tmá \\n \\n \\n \\n\\nThe verb  mít (’have’) incorporates into its v* and after this v*→V1 it can \\nassign Accusative to its Argument Θ2 according to (70b). The Argument Θ2 is a \\n\\n \\n                                                 \\n82   The participle in SPEC(V1) in (95) is derived in its own cycle as in (72) and (73), i,e, it  is \\ngenerated as a lexical verb and is ‘transformed‘ by the insertion of an adjectival suffix. As \\nan adjective, i.e. a [+N] category, the adjectival [+N] derivate it can check the \\nsubcategorisation frame of the transitive verb V1 mít.(‘have‘) and be located in its \\nSPEC(V1).  \\n\\n \\n\\n58 \\n\\n\\x0cconstituent V2/Amax and its A head is co-indexed with its SPEC(V2). The Accusative \\ncase is thus transferred to both of components of the V2 /Amax.83   \\n\\nMoreover, after V1→v* movement the verb mít (’have’) obtains a position for \\n\\nArgument Θ1 in SPEC(V1). According to (70a) this Argument Θ1 receives a \\nstructural Nominative after the head v* adjoins to a finite T  (Θ1→SPEC(T)). \\n\\nNotice that the realisation of a V2-Argument Θ1 inside of the participial \\n\\nPeter has by boss / bossINSTR promisedACC rewardACC \\n‘Peter was promised a reward by his boss.‘ \\n\\nstructure of the verb slíbit (‘promise‘) in (95) is problematic because the verbal head \\nV2 never merges with a light verb v*. According to (70), without the projection of v* \\n(and T) the participle cannot assign either Accusative or Nominative. The following \\nexample in (96) demonstrates that the only grammatical realisation of an Agent for the \\nparticiple is as a PP adjunct realisation. \\n \\n(96)  Petr  má  od šéfa/?šéfem       slíbenou       odměnu \\n \\n \\n \\nWe can observe that in (96) the Instrumental case is not very felicitous: it is \\nsignificantly worse than in the standard Czech analytic passive structures. The \\ndistinction between (96) and the analytic passive structures is in the choice of the \\nAUX verb být (‘be‘) vs. mít (‘have‘), and this correlation leads to the possibility that \\nthe Instrumental Case is related to the presence of (some item-specific property of) the \\nverb být (‘be‘).  \\n \\n(PP) case assigned by some ‘more lexical’ verb být (‘be‘). As (97a) demonstrates, \\nfollowing the copula být (‘be‘), the nominal predicate can in Czech be either \\nNominative (agreeing with the structural subject) or Instrumental.  \\n \\n(97)  \\n\\nConsider the examples in (97) that suggest that Instrumental may be an oblique \\n\\n(a) \\n\\nJá      jsem     učitel          /  učitelem \\nINOM  be1S      teacherNOM / teacherINSTR \\n‘I am a teacher.‘ \\n\\n(b) \\n\\n(b) \\n\\nJá      jsem   kárán    *učitel          / učitelem. \\nINOM  be1S    rebuked *teacherNOM / teacherINSTR \\n‘I am  rebuked by a teacher.‘ \\n\\nJá      jsem   učil    * učitel         / *učitelem     / učitele \\nINOM  be1S    taught *teacherNOM / teacherINSTR / teacherACC \\n‘I was teaching a teacher.‘ \\n\\n \\nThe Instrumental in (97a) looks very similar to the Instrumental Agent with the \\nanalytic passive containing the ‘verbal’ AUX být (’be’) in (97b). Both the examples, \\non the other hand, contrast with the Czech past tense in (97c) where the \\ngrammaticalised AUX  být (’be’) does not seem to influence at all the case assigning \\n\\n \\n                                                 \\n83   We could assume that the [AV+A] complex can be assigned case as a whole and that the \\n\\nfeatures are transferred to the DP in its SPEC. We could alternatively assume that the \\nSPEC(V/A) can receive case itself by some process similar to that in ECM structures.  \\n\\n \\n\\n59 \\n\\n\\x0ccharacteristics of the transitive verb učit (‘teach’), namely it does not combine with \\nInstrumental.84 \\n\\nFor space reasons, however, we will omit here further discussion of the \\n\\nmechanism for assigning Instrumental Case. \\n\\n7  DERIVATION OF PERFECTIVE PASSIVE PARTICIPLES  \\n\\nIn (61) we defined the ordering of levels in the course of deriving the Czech \\n\\nanalytic passive of imperfective verbs, assuming that imperfective passive participles \\nare post-syntactic adjectival derivates as illustrated in (63c). The same concerns some \\nCzech passive structures with perfective verbs.  However, in this section we will \\ndemonstrate that passive structures with perfective verbs can moreover be formed \\nwith a syntactic adjectival derivate of the type (63b), which demonstrates a Merge of \\na V-stem and an A-suffix during rather than after syntactic processing. The proposed \\nphasing of a derivation is suggested in the following (98), which starts in (a) in the \\nsame way as (61a) but starting from the (b) level, the processes are ordered in a \\ndistinct way. \\n  \\n(98) \\n\\n(a) \\n\\n(b) \\n\\nInitial projection of the verbal head V which is taken from the Lexicon  \\nand listed in the initial Numeration. The verbal head realises its \\nsubcategorisation at the level of V, i.e. of its internal Argument Θ2. \\nAt the level of syntax   \\n (i) \\n\\nInserting of the derivational affix  -n-/-t... with the categorial \\nlabel A, composition of the [AV+A] derivate,  \\nco-indexation, i.e. checking of the feature <+N> of the A with \\nthe Phi features of the nominal element in its SPEC, and  \\n\\n (ii) \\n\\n(iii)  Merge and projection of the light verb v* (plus subsequent \\n\\nMerge and projection of the functional head T). \\n\\n(c) \\n\\nAt the level of Phonetic Form the Phi features co-indexed in (b/ii) are \\nrealised as the long adjectival agreement morphology -ý/-á/-é. \\n\\n \\nIn the following section we will show the arguments supporting our claim that the \\nlong versus short type of agreement morphology in Czech is a sign of dissociated \\nlevels versus a single (associated) level of co-indexation and phonetic realisation in \\nthe agreement process.  \\n\\n7.1  The Distinctions between Syntactic and Post-syntactic Adjectival Derivates \\n\\nIn the previous sections we repeatedly suggested that with the Czech -n-/-t- participles \\nthe short (fused/simple) morphology is the standard for the post-syntactic derivates, \\nwhich are able to simultaneously express the imperfective (verbal) aspectual \\nmorphemes. These structures were illustrated in (63c). In the post-syntactic derivate \\nthe insertion of the A suffix takes place at the level of PF which is the same level at \\n\\n \\n                                                 \\n84   For many other distinctions between the ‘more verbal’ (passive) AUX and the ‘more \\n\\ngrammaticalised’ (past) AUX see section 1.5. \\n\\n \\n\\n60 \\n\\n\\x0cwhich the realisation of agreement inflection takes place. On the other hand, the long \\n(complex) morphology signals the more ‘adjectival’  derivates (63a/b), in which the \\nco-indexation takes place before PF and is therefore dissociated from the process of  \\nrealising the inflectional morpheme. We propose that the following (99) may be the \\nright generalisation. \\n\\n \\n\\n(99)  A fused morphology is a result of the features checked and realised at the same \\n\\nlevel of derivation.  \\n\\n \\nAs for passive participles formed with perfective verbs, traditional Czech grammars \\nconsider their morphology as being arbitrarily expressed by either of the two types of \\nforms. If so, Emonds’s rules about the levels of insertion of grammatical morphemes \\nin (57) of Part 1 imply that the level of merge of the adjectival suffix with these verbs \\nis possible at both the syntactic and post-syntactic levels. The two kinds of passive \\nstructures, however, should exhibit distinct characteristics with respect to their \\nadjectival properties.  \\n\\nThe syntactic [AV+A] derivate is of category A before Spell Out and it is also \\n\\ninterpreted as such at Logical form. We therefore assume that it should show \\nsubstantially more adjectival characteristics than the post-syntactic [AV+A] derivate \\nwhich is adjectival only after Spell Out, at Phonetic Form. In the following sections \\nwe are going to provide Czech data supporting the distinction between the two \\nforms.85 \\n\\n7.1.1 Long and Short participial Morphology \\n\\nThe table in (100) illustrates the paradigms of short/nominal (A) and long/pronominal \\n(B) agreement morphology which can both appear with the Czech participles derived \\nfrom verbs with the [+LS/A] feature.  \\n \\n(100)  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n(a) \\n\\nMS \\n\\n(b) \\n\\nFS \\n\\nTrezor byl  \\nsafeMS  wasMS   \\n\\nSkříň byla \\nwardrobeFS wasFS \\n\\n(c) \\n\\nNS  Okno bylo \\n\\nwindowNS wasNS \\n\\nA: Short \\nagreement \\notevře-n-Ø  \\nopen-ADJ+MS.short \\n\\nB:  Long agreement \\n\\notevře-n-ý / votevře-n-ej \\nopen-ADJ+MS.long \\n\\notevře-n-a \\nopen-ADJ+FS.short \\n\\notevře-n-á  \\nopen-ADJ+FS.long \\n\\notevře-n-o \\nopen-ADJ+NS.short \\n\\notevře-n-é / votevře-n-ý  \\nopen-ADJ+NS.long \\n\\n \\n                                                 \\n85   Most tests used in this section have already been used in earlier frameworks to distinguish \\n\\nbetween adjectival and verbal passives in English in the studies by Siegel (1973) and  \\nWasow (1977) and more recently in Emonds (2000, Ch. 5). For Russian, in a fully \\ncompatible framework, similar data are presented in Schoorlemmer (1995). All the tests \\nshow contrasting characteristics of the two kinds of derivates on the levels of morphology, \\nsyntactic and interpretation, thus demonstrating the systematic connection between the \\nlinguistic levels independent of any derivation that might or might not relate them.  \\n\\n \\n\\n61 \\n\\n\\x0c(d) \\n\\nM/FP              \\n\\nTrezory/skříně      byly \\nsafesMP/wardrobesFP wereM/FP \\n\\notevře-n-y \\nopen-ADJ+M/FP.short \\n\\notevře-n-é / votevře-n-ý  \\nopen-ADJ+NS.long \\n\\n(d) \\n\\nNP  Okna          byla \\n\\nwindowsNP wereNP \\n\\notevře-n-a \\nopen-ADJ+NS.short \\n\\notevře-n-á  \\nopen-ADJ+NS.long \\n\\n \\nMany Czech speakers feel that the short (A) form is kind of archaic, while the long \\nform is more common/colloquial. In some contexts, however, only some of them are \\ngrammatical: the stylistic-option approach is therefore not tenable.  \\n\\nThe distinction between the two kinds of morphology nonetheless has a \\n\\ndiachronic dimension.86 The short morphology follows the original basic nominal \\nparadigm, i.e. the endings are the same as the inflectional endings of the main Czech \\nnominal patterns in corresponding Genders. The long morphology comes from the \\nmore complex Old Slavonic paradigm (originally compound, then pronominal or \\nadjectival inflection). Synchronically, we believe that the statement in (99) implies \\nthat the level of grammaticalisation and consequently of the level of insertion are \\naspects of specific grammatical systems which are subject to diachronic change. \\n\\nThe synchronic distinction between long and short morphology is mentioned \\n\\nonly vaguely in traditional descriptive Czech grammar. In attributive (modifying) \\npositions the long/pronominal form is taken as standard (and the short for archaic), \\nwhile in the predicate position the short/nominal form is preferred if the interpretation \\nis [+ACTIVITY], while the short form is better for the interpretation [+STATIVE]. \\nThe distinction between the structures comprising the two morphologically distinct \\nforms is, however, terminologically expressed. The combination of the verb být (‘be’) \\nand the participle with the short agreement (100A) is called an analytic passive (i.e. \\nAUX + past participle), while the combination of the verb být (‘be’) and the derivate \\nwith long agreement (100B) is called a copula - (verbal) adjective complex.  \\n\\nIn a generative framework the Czech (A) form can be given the traditional \\n\\nlabel of verbal passive, while the Czech (B) form can be called adjectival passive.  \\n\\n7.1.2 Interpretive Differences \\n\\nThe semantic distinction between adjectival and verbal passives is discussed in detail \\nfor German in Rapp (1997) and for Russian in Schoorlemmer (1995), and their \\ndiagnostics and conclusions can successfully be applied to Czech. The following (101) \\ncontrasts (A) the post-syntactic derivate (signalled by short morphology) in (101A) \\nwith (B) the syntactic derivate (signalled by long morphology) in (101B/c) with \\nrespect to their ability to be modified by local / temporal / manner adverbials.   \\n \\n(101)  (A)   Dárek       byl zabalen                  v neděli     /  v autě  / rychle  \\npresentMS was packed-ADJ+MS.short on Sunday / in a car / quickly \\n‘The present was packed on Sunday / in a car / quickly.’ \\n\\n(B) \\n\\n*Dárek       byl   zabalený              v neděli    / v autě    / rychle  \\n* presentMS was packed-ADJ+MS.long on Sunday / in a car / quickly \\n\\n \\n                                                 \\n86   See Encyklopedický slovník češtiny (2002:23/440) or Mluvnice češtiny II (1986: 172).  \\n\\n \\n\\n62 \\n\\n\\x0c(c)  \\n\\n \\n\\n Dárek       je zabalený            v růžovém papíru / pěkně \\n  presentMS is packed-ADJ+MS.long in pink paper     / beautifully  \\n‘The present is packed in pink paper / beautifully.’ \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nThe grammatical (101A), which is a post-syntactic derivate (a verbal passive \\nparticiple) interpreted at LF as the category V, can combine (i) with a temporal \\nframe specifying the action of the moment of achieving the result, i.e. it is compatible \\nwith the temporal adverbial ‘on Monday’. It can also combine with (ii) an adverbial \\nof place (’in the car’) and (iii) a VP adverb of manner (’quickly’). None of this is \\npossible with the syntactic derivate (B) in (101B), which tolerates only characterising \\nof an object after the result, as in (101c). This is because the syntactic derivate \\n(101B/c) is interpreted at Logical Form as an Adjective, and this forces the \\ninterpretation of a [+STATE] characteristic that is prototypical for adjectives.   \\n\\n7.1.3 Instrumental Agents \\n\\nAs the following contrasting examples in (102A) show, only the post-syntactic \\nderivate can express its Agent in the form of an Instrumental adjunct. We conclude \\nthat the verbal category V present at LF allows for an Agent interpretation if a \\nnominal constituent is in an appropriate structural position. The same is not possible \\nwith syntactic derivates, as demonstrated in (102B), which behave with respect to this \\ncharacteristics just like the lexical adjective in (102c). We conclude that the categorial \\nhead A does not tolerate an Argument/Agent interpretation at the level of Logical \\nForm.87 \\n \\n(102)  (A)  Okno        bylo  otevře-n-o            policií        / nárazem    větru  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n(B) \\n\\n(c) \\n\\nwindowNS was  opened-ADJ+NS.short policeINSTR /strokeINSTR of wind \\n\\n‘The window was opened by the police/a gust of wind.‘ \\n\\n*Okno         bylo   otevře-n-é            policií       / nárazem    větru \\n* windowNS was   opened-ADJ+NS.long policeINSTR /strokeINSTR of wind \\n\\n*Okno         bylo   špinavé     Petrem      / nárazem    větru \\n* windowNS was  dirtyNS.short PeterINSTR /strokeINSTR of wind \\n\\n‘The window was dirty *by Peter/*a gust of wind.‘ \\n\\n \\n \\nWith lexical adjectives which enter the Numeration already having an A head, \\nArguments can be interpreted more freely. The following example of a plausibly \\nlexical adjective derivate (103a) does not disallow an interpretation in which ‘Peter‘ \\nhas also an Agent interpretation in a hypothetical active structure, which is not an easy \\noption with verbal passives as in (103b) \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n                                                 \\n87   This contrast is not very sharp in as much as some syntactic derivates (B) can combine \\n\\nwith Agent interpreted Instrumentals as well:  \\n(i)  Ten dopis je podepsaný         Petrem. \\n\\nthe   letter is signed-ADJ+MS.long PeterINSTR \\n‘The letter was signed by Peter.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n63 \\n\\n\\x0c(103)  (a) \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n(b) \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nPetr   byl  unave-n-ý  \\nPeter was tired ADJ+MS.long \\n‘Peter was tired (because he made himself tired).‘ \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nPetr   byl  zabi-t-Ø  \\nPeter was killedADJ+MS.short \\n‘Peter was killed (??because he killed himself).‘ \\n\\n \\n\\n7.1.4 Grading of an Adjective \\n\\nAs for the adjectival characteristics of the derivates (A) and (B), the following \\nexample (104a) shows that neither of them fully conforms to the categorial \\ncharacteristics of Adjectives, namely neither of them is able to be graded. Grading \\nremains a property of a lexical adjectives illustrated in the contrasting (104b). Notice \\nthat the hypothetical comparative/superlative form of (A) and (B) is not able to \\ndistinguish between the two forms because the long-short distinction is neutralised by \\nthe comparative/superlative morpheme: in (104a) the only distinction between the two \\nparticiples is in lexical Aspect. \\n \\n(104)  (a)  \\n\\n??Pokoj byl  uklizen-ější / uklízen-ější než pracovna \\n?? room was tidiedCOMP                         than study \\n’The room was more tidy than the study.‘ \\n\\n(b)  \\n\\nPokoj byl vět-ší / čist-ší    než pracovna  \\nroom was bigger/cleaner than study \\n’The room was bigger/cleaner than the study.‘ \\n\\n \\nThe ungrammaticality of (104a) becomes clearer when the characteristics of the post-\\nsyntactic derivate (A) is reinforced by another indication of its nature, i.e. by the \\npresence of an Agent as in (105).88 \\n \\n(105) \\n\\n \\n\\n*Pokoj     byl  uklízenější Petrem       než pracovna  \\n*roomMS was tidiedCOMP    PeterINSTR than study \\n’By Peter, the room was more tidied than the study.‘ \\n\\n \\n                                                 \\n88  The arguments in this section are weakened by the fact that many speakers feel hardly any \\n\\ndistinction between the short vs. long morphology. Moreover, even some post-syntactic \\nderivates (A) can be graded and still keep their verbal interpretation.   \\n(i)  Pokoj byl ukl-i-zen-ější / ukl-í-zen-ější  než pracovna.  \\n\\n?? room was tidiedCOMP.shorttidiedCOMP.long?  than study \\n’The room was more tidy than the study.‘ (= more often / in a better way) \\n\\n \\n\\nThe presence of Agent in the Instrumental in (ii) below is not expected because it clearly \\ninvolves a post-syntactic derivate (A). The example was, however, found in a Czech \\ncorpus, showing the weakened sensitivity of some speakers to distinct adjectival agreement \\nmorphemes. \\n(i)  Zprávy jsou sledovan-ější  diváky         v Praze     než   v  menších městech. \\n\\nNews    are   watchedCOMP audienceINSTR in Prague than in smaller towns \\n‘The news is watched by the audience more in Prague than in smaller towns.‘   \\n\\n \\n\\n64 \\n\\n\\x0c \\nThe examples in (106a) illustrate a property related to grading, namely that post-\\nsyntactic derivates do not tolerate combination with the grading adverb více (‘more‘) \\nand even the syntactic derivate (B) with a long agreement (106b) is much worse than a \\nlexical adjective in (106c). \\n  \\n(106)   (A) \\n\\n* Pokoj     byl mnohem více   uklíze-n-Ø  než    pracovna \\n* roomMS was much    more tidiedMS.short   than study \\n’The room was much more tidied than the study.‘ \\n\\n(B) \\n\\n(c) \\n\\n?

As (107A) \\nillustrates, the position of the prefix is grammatical only in the finite AUX part of the \\ncomplex. The contrasting example (108) shows that with the syntactic derivate (B) (or \\na lexical adjective) the position of negative prefix is free. \\n \\n(107)  [A] \\n\\n(a)  \\n\\nPokoj ne-byl     (Petrem)     uklize-n-Ø  \\nroom   not-was (PeterINSTR) cleanedADJshort \\n‘The room wasn’t cleaned (by Peter).‘ \\n\\n \\n(108)   [B] \\n\\n(b) \\n\\n(a) \\n\\n(b) \\n\\n*Pokoj byl   (Petrem)     ne-uklize-n-Ø \\n* room  was (PeterINSTR) not-cleanedADJshort \\n\\nPokoj ne-byl    uklize-n-ý    / čistý \\nroom  not-was tidyADJ.long / clean \\n‘The room wasn’t tidy / clean.‘ \\n\\nPokoj byl ne-uklize-n-ý   / ne-čistý \\nroom was not-tidyADJ.long / not-clean \\n‘The room was untidy / unclean.‘ \\n\\n \\nAssuming that the negative prefix is an indication of some maximal projection, the \\nexample (108) suggests that the copula heads a maximal projection (plausibly Vmax), \\nand that the passive participle does as well (plausibly Amax). The ungrammaticality of \\n(107) on the other hand shows that the post-syntactic derivate [AV+A] is not analysed \\nas a maximal projection at the level of syntax, but it forms only one component of an \\nextended verbal complex v*P. \\n\\n \\n\\n65 \\n\\n\\x0c7.1.6 Selecting verbs  \\n\\nAnother traditional distinction between adjectives and verbal participles \\n\\nconcerns the verb which selects them. Compared with the number of verbs selecting \\nadjectives (and adjectival passive derivates), the number of verbs selecting a verbal \\npassive participle is more restricted.  \\n\\nIn Czech the contrast is not too significant because there is a relatively small \\n\\nnumber of verbs selecting adjectives. Still, the contrast in (109) is clear. It shows that \\nboth a lexical adjective and a syntactic derivate (B) in (109B) can be a complement of \\nverbs like být ‘be‘ or zůstat ‘remain‘. On the other hand, a post-syntactic derivate (A) \\nwith short agreement morphology in (109A) can be selected only by the verb být ‘be‘.  \\n \\n(109)  (A) \\n\\n / pochvále-n-Ø. \\n\\n(a) \\n\\nPetr  je / *zůstal  \\nPeter is / *remained   tiredADJ.MS.short / praisedADJ.MS.short \\n‘Peter is / *remained tired/praised.‘ \\n\\nunave-n-Ø  \\n\\n \\n\\n(b) \\n\\nKomora je /*zůstala   ukli(í)ze-n-a.        / otevře-n-a \\nHall       is /*remained cleanedADJ.FS.short  / openedADJ.FS.short \\n‘The hall is / *remained cleaned/opened.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n(B)  \\n\\n(a) \\n\\nPetr   je / zůstal  \\nPeter is / remained  \\n‘Peter is/remained tired/praised. \\n\\nunave-n-ý \\ntiredADJ.MS.long / praisedADJ.MS.long \\n\\n/ chvále-n-ý \\n\\n(b) \\n\\nKomora je / zůstal      uklize-n-á            / otevře-n-á. \\nHall       is / remained cleanedADJ.FS.long  / openedADJ.FS.long \\n‘The hall is / remained clean/open. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nAccording to our analysis the ungrammaticality of (109A) is caused by a restricted \\nsubcategorial frame of the verb zůstat, which is not as general as the frame of the \\nCzech být ‘be‘ mentioned already in (42) of Part 1. We suggest that the verb zůstat \\ndoes not select a [+V] complement, and that the post-syntactic derivate [AV+A] in \\n(109A) is a category V at the level of syntax, where the subcategorisation of the verb \\nzůstat has to be checked. Contrary to the verbs selecting Aps, the verb být ‘be‘ is an \\nitem  from the Czech Syntacticon and it can therefore become a part of the derivation \\nat any level. Assuming that the selection restrictions are to be satisfied by the \\noperation Merge, the verb být ‘be‘ can combine with a [AV+A] derivate of any type. \\n\\nThe following example (110) also demonstrates that the post-syntactic derivate \\n\\n(A) cannot be used in a Czech equivalent of a raising structure, while a syntactic \\nderivate (B), as well as a lexical adjective čistá ‘clean‘, can be.89  \\n \\n(110)  (A) \\n \\n\\n*Pracovna se zdá být     uklize-n-a              matkou \\n*study        seems to-be cleanedADJ.FS.short motherINSTR \\n‘The study seems to be cleaned by mother.‘ \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n                                                 \\n89   We are not going to deal with raising here, partly because of the low productivity of this \\n\\nconstruction in Czech. The contrast in (110) is nonetheless clear.  \\n\\n \\n\\n66 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n \\n\\n(B)   Pracovna se zdá být     uklize-n-á           / čist-á \\n \\n\\nstudy        seems to-be cleanedADJ.FS.long / clean FS \\n‘The study seems to be cleaned / clean.‘ \\n\\n \\nThe above example demonstrates the more adjectival nature of a syntactic derivate \\n[AV+A] with long agreement morphology in (B), compared to the more verbal post-\\nsyntactic derivate [AV+A] with the short agreement ending in (A).  \\n\\n7.1.7 Heterogeneous Agreement  \\n\\nIn section 6.1 we proposed that the short agreement morpheme (A) represents a fusion \\nof (i) a derivational adjectival morpheme and (ii) the agreement ending. As stated in \\n(99), this fusion is a result of the fact that both components enter the derivation in the \\nsame level, here at the level of Phonological Form. As for long agreement (B), we \\nproposed that it results from the disjoint insertion of the two morphemes in different \\nlevels, which prevents their fusion: the insertion of the adjectival suffix (and the co-\\nindexation of the A category with the Phi features in its domain) already takes place at \\nthe level of syntax, and thus precedes the insertion of PF agreement morphology.  \\n\\nThe phasing of the insertion process also allows us to account for a distinction \\n\\nbetween (A) and (B) derivates concerning Partitive Genitives in subjects realised as \\nquantified nominal phrases. Notice the distinct feature contents of the components of \\nthe subject complex:  pět (‘fiveNS.NOM‘) and vojáků  (‘soldiersMP.GEN’), and compare \\nthem with the feature content of the verbal agreements reflected on the [AV+A] \\nderivates  zraněn-(‘wounded‘). \\n \\n(111)  (A) \\n\\n \\n\\nPět               vojáků            bylo3SN  zraně-n-o \\nfive3SN.NOM soldiersMP.GEN was3SN  woundedADJ.SN.NOM.short \\n‘Five soldiers were wounded.’ \\n\\n(B) \\n\\nPět             vojáků              bylo      zraně-n-ých \\nfive3SN.NOM soldiersMP.GEN was3SN  woundedADJ.MP.GEN.long \\n‘Five soldiers were wounded.’ \\n\\n \\nIn both examples in (111) the AUX reflects the default 3SN features of the quantifier. \\nBut in the [AV+A] derivates  zraněn- (‘wounded‘), the examples diverge: in (111A) \\nboth the verbal participle with short morphology and the AUX show the same \\nfeatures, i.e. the agreement is ‘homogenous’.  On the other hand, in (111B) the \\nagreement is ‘hetergeneous’, i.e. the two components of the analytic verbal form \\nexhibit distinct features: the adjectival derivate (participle) shows MP.GEN, which are \\nthe features of the complement of Q, vojáků (’soldiersMP.GEN’) and the AUX reflects \\nthe default 3SN features.   \\n\\nThe following example (111c) gives a structure for a lexical adjective (and \\n\\ncopula) showing a pattern identical to (B). 90  \\n\\n \\n                                                 \\n90   For more discussion of Slavic quantifiers followed by a (Partitive) Genitive see Babby \\n(1987) and Franks (1995,) and for Czech Karlík (2000) and Veselovská (2001b). The \\nterminology concerning “homogenous/ heterogeneous” agreements is from Franks (1995).  \\n\\n \\n\\n67 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n(111)  (c) \\n\\n \\n\\nPět             vojáků             bylo      šťastných  \\nfive3SN.NOM soldiersMP.GEN was3SN  happyMP.GEN.long  /*happy SN.NOM.short \\n‘Five soldiers were happy.’ \\n\\n/*šťastno \\n\\nIn (112) we schematically illustrate our analysis of the heterogeneous \\n\\nagreement pattern exemplified in (111).  \\n\\nWe assume that an agreement between the participle and the subject is created \\n\\nin the structural relation SPEC(V/A) and V/A in (112). However, at the initial \\nderivational level of (112) in the V/A domain, at least two items involved are from the \\ngrammatical system of Czech (the Czech Syntacticon) and therefore do not have to \\nenter the initial Numeration: these are the quantifier (Q) pět (‘five‘) and the adjectival \\nsuffix (A) –n-. (Both items are circled at the bottom of the scheme). Because of their \\ngrammatical nature, these items can be missing in the initial levels of the derivation.  \\n\\nAs for (111B), the heterogeneous agreement pattern suggests that the elements \\nwhich enter agreement relations with the two components of the analytic verbal form \\nare not identical. We propose that at the level where the verbal (participial) agreement \\nis established, the grammatical element - Q pět (‘five‘) - is not yet present in the \\nstructure, while the A suffix already is. 91 This adjectival suffix of the adjectival \\npassive participle is therefore co-indexed with the Phi features of the head of the \\nnominal complex in subject position, which, in the absence of the Q head, is the \\nNominal head vojáků  (‘soldiersMP.GEN’) in a structure [QP -- [NP soldiersMP.GEN ]. This \\nagreement relation is marked by a bold arrow [B] at the bottom of (112). \\n \\nSuch co-indexation can at this level express only the features of Gender and \\nNumber, because structural Genitive is not yet assigned. GEN will become a part of \\nthe Phi feature complex only at PF, and at the PF level the co-indexation is realised by \\na non-fused, long agreement morphology, which is also exemplified in (111B). \\n\\n \\n                                                 \\n91   Our analysis assumes the insertion of the adjectival suffix prior to the insertion of the \\n\\nQuantifier head, in accord with the general bottom up sequencing of Merge.  It is therefore \\nirrelevant whether the adjectival suffix is present in the Numeration or only in the syntactic \\nderivation: in both cases it is present prior to the insertion of the Quantifier, and so the \\nagreement is long/ adjectival, as seen in (111B/c) \\n\\n \\n\\n68 \\n\\n\\x0c(112)            \\n \\n \\n\\nTMAX \\n\\nSPEC(T)                      \\n[QP fiveSN.NOM  [NP soldiers]    \\n \\n\\nTP \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n           v* + T \\nbyl-o \\n \\n \\nwas3SN \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n    (Vmax) Amax  \\n \\n     \\n\\n \\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n    Qmax     \\n            \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n        (V)Amax \\n  \\n\\n    Q0                  NP                 V0                   A0 \\n\\n \\n\\n                pět       \\n\\nvojáků   \\n\\nzraněn- \\n\\n-n+ých   /  -n-o     \\n\\nfiveSN.NOM     soldiersMP.GEN wound -ADJ+MP.GEN.long    /  ADJ+SN.NOMshort\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n                           [B] \\n\\n [A] \\n\\n \\n     \\n\\n  \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nAs for the structure (111A) with a post-syntactic adjectival derivate of (A) type \\n\\n(a verbal passive participle), the co-indexation of the adjectival suffix and the Phi \\nfeatures of the nominal complex is delayed until the stage of PF. It is on this level that \\nthe structure of the quantified complex is [QP fiveSN.NOM  [NP soldiersMP.GEN ], with the \\nhead Q pět (‘five‘) entering into agreement with the A suffix. The relation between \\nSPEC(V/A) and (V/A). i.e. the co-indexation between the Q and the A suffix, is \\nindicated with a broken arrow [A] in the bold text at the bottom of (112). Because the \\nco-indexation and realisation of the agreement are both taking place at PF, the \\nresulting morpheme in (111A) is short (fused), and the resulting agreement pattern \\nshows the same agreement features (default, 3SN) on both components of the analytic \\nverbal form.  \\n\\nIn the domain of  TP in the high periphery of the structure in (112), the italics \\n\\nshow the final stage of derivation. The complex subject  pět vojáků (‘five soldiers‘) \\noccupies the position of SPEC(T) and enters into a relation with the verb být (‘be‘). In \\nthis final stage of derivation the subject complex has the structure [QP fiveSN.NOM  [NP \\nsoldiersMP.GEN ] , i.e. its head is the Q pět (‘five3SN‘), and its default features therefore \\ndetermine the agreement with the AUX.92 \\n\\n \\n                                                 \\n92   More detailed discussion of the disjoint agreements in Czech on AUX and the participle, in \\n\\nboth passive and past analytic tenses, is provided in Veselovská (2003). \\n\\n \\n\\n69 \\n\\n\\x0cThe same analysis can be applied to passive participles used in combination \\n\\nwith the AUX mít (‘have’) discussed in section 6.3 in (95). The following examples \\nshow that they reflect the same distinction in agreement (Accusative) morphology \\nwhen the object is a nominal complex containing a quantifier assigning Partitive \\nGenitive. As we predict, example (113A) demonstrates that the post-syntactic derivate \\n(the participle with short agreement) can agree only with the Q3SN.ACC, while the long \\nmorphology as well as a lexical adjective špinavý (‘dirty’), in (113B) can agree only \\nwith the quantified NP in GEN. \\n \\n(113).

We have argued that this is a result of the presence vs. absence of the \\nadjectival suffix at Spell Out (and consequently at Logical Form).  \\n\\nThe presence of the adjectival suffix, which forms a right-hand head of the \\n\\ncomplex [AV+A] at an interpretative interface, must therefore be reflected in the \\ninterpretation. In the acceptable examples in (111B) the interpretation is [+STATE], \\ni.e. assuming that the soldiers were in a wounded state (by means of themselves or \\nsomebody/something else), and no Aspect feature plays any role. On the other hand in \\nthe grammatical (111A) the interpretation depends on the feature of [±LS/A] Aspect \\nexpressed by the verbal participle, as demonstrated in (114).  \\n \\n(114) \\n\\nPět              vojáků            bylo      (z)raněno        / (z)raň-ová-no. \\nfive3SN.NOM soldiersMP.GEN was3SN  wounded[-LS/A] / [+LS/A] \\n‘Five soldiers were wounded / repeatedly wounded.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nThe example (115A) further demonstrates that the presence of a feature Aspect \\ncorrelates with the presence of the short morphology, the sure sign of a post-syntactic \\nderivate (A). (115B) shows that with the long morphology, the (B) derivate is not \\nfelicitous in combination with an adverbial signalling progressive (repetitive) Aspect.  \\n \\n(115)  (A)  Okno        bylo  opakovaně otevíráno.  \\n\\nwindowNS was repeatedly   openedNS.short \\n‘A window was being repeatedly opened.‘ \\n\\n \\n\\n70 \\n\\n\\x0c(B) \\n\\n??Okno          bylo  opakovaně otevírané. \\n?? windowNS was   repeatedly  openedNS.long \\n\\n \\nThis distinction directly follows from our analysis, which assumes that in Czech \\nAspect is a semantic (lexical) property of a verbal stem. If so, than the visibility, i.e. \\ninterpretability of a feature of Aspect at Logical Form, is a property of the form which \\nenters LF as a Verb, i.e. without the derivational head A.  \\n\\n7.2.2 Tense and Aspect of the AUX \\n\\nFor the interpretation of the feature of [+LS/A] Aspect on an adjectival derivate \\n(passive participle) the feature content of the AUX is also relevant, especially the \\npresence of a marked Tense. The example (116A) shows that an Agent, which implies \\nthe structure for a post-syntactic derivate (A), prefers combining with an auxiliary \\ncarrying marked features of tense/modality, i.e. byl/bude (‘was/will-be‘). When the \\nverb is rather in the unmarked present tense, e.g. je (‘is‘), most speakers prefer the \\nadjectival form as in (116B). This demonstrates that both the syntactic and lexical \\nadjectival derivates preferably occur with no marked temporal feature.93 \\n \\n(116)  (A)  Okno        ??je/bylo/bude  otevře-n-o               policií         \\nwindowNS ??is/was/will-be  opened-ADJ+NS.short policeINSTR  \\n‘The window is/was/will be opened by the police.‘ \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n(B)  Okno          je/bylo/bude   otevře-n-é           / čisté             \\n\\nwindowNS is/was/will-be opened-ADJ+NS.long / clean \\n‘The window is/was/will be open / clean.’ \\n\\n7.2.3 Temporal Frame of the Analytic Form  \\n\\nAs discussed in (43) of Part 1, Czech Aspect [+LS/A] has a feature ‘limiting \\n \\nthe State and/or Action’ i.e. restricting the verbal state/action at or by the moment of \\nachieving the result. Verbs with this feature allow reference to the temporal frame in \\nwhich the moment of achieving the result precedes or follows the moment of speech. \\nIt does not, however, allow a temporal frame in which the moment of achieving the \\nresult (which is fixed) is identical with the moment of speech (which is a variable \\ndepending on physical time).  \\n\\nThe following (117a) demonstrates that in the Czech analytic passive, the Past \\n\\nTense expressed on the finite AUX být (‘be‘)in combination with the [+LS/A] \\nparticiple (i.e. verbal (A) participle with short agreement morphology) is interpreted \\nas the moment of achieving the result preceding the moment of speech. The Future \\nTense, signalled by a future AUX, i.e. by bud-u/-eš/-e (‘be1/2/3S.FUT’) as in (117b) \\nexpresses in combination with the [+LS/A] participle that the moment of achieving the \\nresult follows the act of speech (without inferring anything about the present state or \\naction).  In combination with the Present Tense of the AUX být (‘be‘) the [+LS/A] \\n\\n \\n                                                 \\n93  This correlation between the Tense of AUX and the variants (A) and (B) is not explained \\n\\nhere. We limit this discussion to descriptive facts and a suggestion that some further \\ndifferences plausibly result from distinct levels of grammaticalisation of the verb být ‘be’. \\n\\n \\n\\n71 \\n\\n\\x0cAspectual feature on the participle forces interpreting the moments of achieving the \\nresult and of speech as disjoint, as demonstrated in (117c). \\n \\n(117)  (a) \\n\\nHala    byla        uklize-n-a            špatně  \\nhallFS   beFS.PAST cleanedADJ+FS.short badly \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n            ‘The hall was cleaned badly.‘ \\n\\n(b) \\n\\nHala    bude     uklize-n-a             špatně  \\nhallFS   be3S.FUT cleanedADJ+FS.short badly \\n\\n           ‘The hall will be cleaned badly.‘ \\n\\n(c) \\n\\n \\n\\nHala   je           uklize-n-a            špatně.  \\nhallFS be3S.PRES cleanedADJ+FS.short badly \\n‘The hall has (already) been cleaned badly.‘ (not: is being cleaned) \\n\\n \\n \\nThese distinct references to the temporal frame by the finite AUX and the verbal past \\nparticiple (a post-syntactic adjectival derivate) clearly indicate that the two elements \\neach have their own independent syntactic identity. We conclude then that at the \\ninterpretative interface both items are separate objects, i.e. in the complex verbal \\nstructure (72) the head V is at LF separate from the head v*.  \\n\\n7.2.4 Future Tense \\n\\nNotice now the contrast between the examples in (118). Both structures contain a \\nfinite AUX in FUT, i.e bud-u/-eš/-e (‘be1/2/3S.FUT’) which combines with an infinitive. \\nThe example (118a) is a Czech analytic Future Tense, demonstrating that the infinitive \\nwhich follows a Future AUX can only be imperfect. On the other hand, the \\ncombination of an identical AUX with a passive participle in (118b) tolerates both \\nperfective and imperfective participles.  \\n \\n(118)  (a) \\n\\nbude       psá-t             \\nbe3S.FUT  writeINF[-LS/A]  \\n\\n/ *napsa-t  \\n/ *writeINF[+LS/A] \\n\\n(b) \\n\\n bude       psá-n-Ø  \\nbe3S.FUT  writtenADJ.MS.short[-LS/A]  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n/ napsá-n-Ø  \\n/ writeADJ-MS.short [+LS/A] \\n\\n \\nOur analysis offers a simple explanation for the contrast in (118). We propose that \\n(118a) contains an infinitive of a transitive verb psát  (‘write‘) which has a structure \\n[v*V+v*]. The future AUX bud-u/-eš/-e (‘be1/2/3S.FUT) is located in a functional \\nprojection c-commanding the v*P as illustrated in (119a). The functional projection is \\nlabelled as Asp(ect), but filling it with the future AUX bud-u/-eš/-e (‘be1/2/3S.FUT’) as in   \\n(119a) blocks the [+] value of the Aspect feature of the participle.94   \\n \\n\\n \\n                                                 \\n94   For the restriction of the Aspect feature of the infinitive after the aspectual verbs and \\n\\nfuture AUX see (25) and (44) of Part 1. This restriction might alternatively be explained in \\nterms of a more specific selection by the AUX  být, V [__-LS/A].  For advantages and \\ndisadvantages of this analysis see e.g. Veselovská (1995) and Kosta (2001).  \\n\\n \\n\\n72 \\n\\n\\x0c(119)  (a) AUX in a Czech Analytic Future   (b) AUX in a Czech Analytic Passive  \\n\\n \\n\\n                                 AspP \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nv* \\n\\n       \\n\\nv*P \\n\\n        AspP \\n \\nAsp \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\nBudu   psát/*napsat    tv \\n \\nbeFUT  writeINF[-LS/A]/*-[+LS/A]   \\n\\n           VP \\n\\n V \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n            Asp \\n\\n             v*P \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n            v* \\n\\n            [AV+A]P \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n            [AV+A] \\n\\nbude   [být] \\nbeFUT    \\n\\n    psá-n /  napsá-n \\n  writtenADJ[-LS/A] /[+LS/A] \\n\\n \\n\\nThe scheme (119b) on the right illustrates our analysis of a future passive. It combines \\nthe structure of a future in (119a) with the structure of an analytic passive as in (72). It \\nmeans that the passive AUX bud-u/-eš/-e (‘be1/2/3S.FUT’) is generated in the head v* c-\\ncommanding the passive participle as in (72) and at the same time is a Future tense in \\nthe structure  (119a). (119b) proposes that the passive AUX in the Future contains a \\nzero allomorph of the infinitive of the verb být (‘be‘).  \\n\\nThe presence of a zeroed infinitive of the verb být (‘be‘) in the future passive is \\n\\nfurther confirmed by the paradigm (120) showing that this empty morpheme can \\nindependently carry a [-LS/A] Aspect feature. In the following table the left column \\ngives a Past/Present/Future Czech verbal paradigm, and the right column shows the \\nsame for a passive AUX.95  \\n\\nIn as much as the passive AUX is expected to exhibit characteristics identical  \\nto those of copula/existential verbs, the paradigm licenses the existence of a zero INF \\nmorpheme.  \\n \\n(120) \\n\\npracovat  (‘to work’) \\n\\nbýt (‚to be‘) \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n(a) \\n\\n(b) \\n\\n(c) \\n\\nprac-uji \\nwork1SAGR     (‘I work‘) \\n\\npracoval          jsem \\nworkPART/PAST AUX-BEPRES \\n‘I worked‘ \\n\\nbudu              pracovat   \\nAUX-BEFUT  workINF[-LS/A] \\n‘I will work‘ \\n\\n(a)‘ \\n\\n(b)‘ \\n\\n(c)‘ \\n\\njs-em  \\nbeAGR          (‘I am‘) \\n\\nbyl               jsem  \\nbePART/PAST AUX-BEPRES \\n‘I was‘ \\n\\nbudu               [být]   \\nAUX-BEFUT+ Ø beINF[-LS/A] \\n‘I will be‘ \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n                                                 \\n95   As we illustrated above in section 1.5,  the Czech passive AUX is identical with the Czech \\ncopula/ existential být (‘be’). I. e. each of the forms of the verb být (‘be’) in (120a’/b’/c’) \\ncan combine with unaven/smutný/doma (‘tired/sad/at home’) to form analytic passives, \\ncopulas with predicate adjectives or locational copulas. \\n\\n \\n\\n73 \\n\\n\\x0cThe presence of an empty morpheme for the infinitive of the passive AUX být (‘be’) \\nin the Czech analytic future is also supported by the following .The table in (121) \\ngives the paradigmatic variation for the passive AUX být (‘be’) in the context (121a). \\nThe form in (121b) demonstrates that the AUX is able to carry an independent feature \\nof the iterative Aspect [+IT]. (121c) demonstrates an empty infinitive for být (‘be’) in \\nthe future, as proposed in (119) and (120). This is independently supported by (121d): \\nthe same infinitive, when it carries the feature of Aspect [+IT], must become overt.96 \\n \\n(121)   (a) \\n\\nHala je       uklize-n-a \\nhall   isPRES cleanADJ.short \\n\\n \\n\\n          ‘The hall is cleaned. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n(a) \\n(b) \\n(c) \\n(d) \\n\\nje \\nbývá \\nbude  [být] \\nbude bývat \\n\\nbePRES \\nbePRES[-PERF] [+IT] \\nAUX-BEFUT+ Ø beINF[-LS/A] \\nAUX-BEFUT+ beINF[+IT] \\n\\n(‘is‘) \\n(‘tends to be‘) \\n(‘will be‘) \\n(‘will usually be‘) \\n\\n7.3  Verbal Adjective Attributes  \\n\\nIn this section we are going to briefly demonstrate the similarity of verbal adjective \\nattributes with passive participles in similar positions, showing that they are both a \\nkind of [AV+A] hybrid as illustrated in (49) of Part 1.  \\n\\nThe examples (122) illustrate that Czech verbal adjectives can be used in both \\n\\npre- and post-modifier position, and that they can realise both internal and external \\nArguments of the related verb in forms comparable to those with the analytic passive.  \\n \\n(122)   (a)  \\n\\nučitelem      chvále-n-ý           Pavel        stál    u tabule \\nteacherINSTR praisedADJ.long.NOM PaulNOM   stood at blackboard \\n‘Paul praised by a teacher was standng at the blackboard.‘ \\n\\n(b) \\n\\nPavel,     chvále-n-ý            učitelem      stál    u tabule \\nPaulNOM praisedADJ.long.NOM teacherINSTR stood at blackboard  \\n‘Paul praised by a teacher was standing at the blackboard ‘ \\n\\n \\nThough similar, the verbal adjective attributes and passive participles are not identical. \\nAlthough short and long agreement morphemes can both occur in predicate position, \\n(123) shows that in attribute position the agreement morphology must be long. \\n \\n(123)  (a) \\n\\nučitelem       chvále-n-á  / *chvále-n-a dívka   \\nteacherINSTR praisedADJ.long/*short             girlNOM     \\n‘a girl praised by a teacher‘ \\n\\n(b) \\n\\ndívka     chvále-n-á  / *chvále-n-a učitelem \\ngirlNOM  praisedADJ.long/*short            teacherINSTR \\n\\n \\n                                                 \\n96   As in (50) of Part 1, passive participles cannot carry the [+IT] affix; it is possible only on \\n\\nthe AUX as in (121b/d).  \\n\\n \\n\\n74 \\n\\n\\x0c \\nAnother distinction is illustrated in the following example. Contrary to the post-\\nsyntactic derivates (verbal participles) which occur only in structural cases, the Czech \\nverbal adjective attributes have morphology for all genders, numbers and Cases \\nincluding oblique, e.g. the prepositional Locative in (124). \\n \\n(124)  o       chlapci       / dívkách      chvále-n-ém  / -n-ých  učitelem \\n\\nabout boyMS.LOC  / girlsFP.LOC praisedADJ.long-MS/FP.LOC teacherINSTR \\n‘about a boy / girls praised by a teacher.‘ \\n\\n \\n \\nAs we proposed in sections 4.4.3 and 7.1 and as suggested by (99),  the long \\nagreement morphology signifies that the adjectival suffix (with head A) in the hybrid \\ncategory [AV+A]  is co-indexed with the Phi features of a nominal complex in a \\nchecking domain prior to Phonological Form. The distinction between attribute \\nagreement and the adjectival passive participle was illustrated in (63a/b/c). We \\nproposed that the attribute agreement results from the unification of the [AV+A] \\ncomplex inside the Lexicon, i.e. the initial Numeration contains the lexical derivate \\n(63a). The structure proposed in (89a) in 6.1.1 also explains the ability of attributive \\nderived adjectives to bear oblique case.  \\n\\nOn the other hand, the feature [+V], which is a part of the categorial \\n\\ncharacteristics of even an adjective that enters the Numeration as a complex  [AV+A], \\nallows the interpretation (at Logical From) of related non-obligatory Arguments, as \\ndemonstrated in (122)/(123)/(124).  \\n\\nThe examples in (125) show that in addition to interpretation, the binding \\n\\nrelations of verbal adjective attributes are also parallel to those in passive structures, \\ni.e. the reflexive anaphor in the Instrumental Agent takes the internal Argument for its \\nantecedent in both passive (125a) and attributive (125b/c) structures.97 \\n \\n(125)  (a) \\n\\nChlapec  byl   chválen                 svým učitelem \\nboyNOMi  was praisedADJ.short-NOM REFLi/*k teacherINSTR \\n‘The boyi was praised by hisi/*k teacher.‘ \\n\\n(b) \\n \\n\\n(c) \\n\\n \\n\\nJan    viděl      chlapce chváleného        svým učitelem \\nJohni saw [NP boyACCk  praisedADJ.long-ACC REFL*i/k teacherINSTR \\n‘Johni saw a boyk praised by his*i/k teacher.’ \\n\\nEvai mluvila o [NP chlapcij     chváleném              svým*i/j učitelem] \\nEvaj spoke about [NP boyLOCj  praisedADJ.long-LOC REFL*i/j teacherINSTR \\n‘Eve i spoke about a boyj praised by his*i/j teacher.’ \\n\\n7.3.1 Floating Quantifiers \\n\\nAnother distinction between the lexical [AV+A] derivates and post-syntactic [AV+A] \\nderivates (63c) is related to the distribution of floating quantifiers in the contrasting \\nexamples (126) and (127). The examples in (126) contain lexical adjectives (63a) with \\n \\n                                                 \\n97   We do not propose any precise structure for the binding of the anaphors. The examples are \\n\\ngiven here only to show the similarity between derived adjectives and passive participles. \\n\\n \\n\\n75 \\n\\n\\x0clong agreement morphology, i.e. copula+adjective structures, and furthermore \\ndemonstrate that this structure can appear in Czech in a number of acceptable word \\norders. (In the examples the quantified nominal complex pět štěňat, i.e.[QP five [NP \\npuppies]], is underlined.) \\n \\n(126)  (a) \\n\\nPět štěňat          bylo zraně-n-ých          zlým klukem.  \\nfive puppiesGEN was  hurtADJ.long.GEN bad boyINSTR \\n‘Five puppies were hurt by a bad boy.‘ \\nPět bylo štěňat zraněných zlým klukem  \\nZlým klukem zraněných štěňat bylo pět  \\nŠtěňat zraněných zlým klukem bylo pět \\n\\n \\nThe contrasting examples (127) demonstrate that the post-syntactic [AV+A] derivates \\n(63c) in analytic passive structures do not allow the same variety of word orders.  \\n \\n(127)  (a) \\n\\nPět štěňat         bylo  zraně-n-o          zlým klukem.  \\nfive puppiesGEN was  hurtADJ.short.NOM bad boyINSTR \\n‘Five puppies were hurt by a bad boy.‘ \\n*Pět bylo štěňat zraněno zlým klukem  \\n*Zlým klukem zraněno štěňat bylo pět  \\n*Štěňat zraněno zlým klukem bylo pět \\n\\n(b) \\n(c) \\n(d) \\n\\n(b) \\n(c) \\n(d) \\n\\n \\nThe distinction between (126) and (127) ) are caused by the different derivational \\nstatus of the underlined structures. We assume that the copula-adjective structure is \\nbase-generated with the lexical adjective in the position of a post-modifier of the \\nnoun, as in (128). The co-indexation of the A and N heads marked as PHI indicates the \\nchecking domain for adjectival agreement.98  \\n \\n(128) \\n \\n \\n\\n                   Nmax \\n\\n      Qmax \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n     Q \\n     \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n    \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n      NP  \\n \\n \\n\\n           Amax \\n  \\n     AP   \\n     A0   \\n\\nDP/PP \\n \\n\\n   ( pět)      štěňat       zraněnýchPHI    zlým klukem \\n    (five)    puppiesPHI hurtADJ.long.PHI  bad boyINSTR \\n\\n \\n                                                 \\n98   For more discussion on genitive agreement and the quantifier assigning genitive, see \\n\\nsection 7.1.7. As for the position of the Instrumental Agent in (128) we propose it is a PP \\nadjunct of the AP. Given that in the scheme (128) this adjunct is c-commanded by the NP \\nštěňat (‘puppies‘), the binding relations in (125b/c) seem to be explained. We,however, do \\nnot further argue for the suggested structure (128) of Agent Interpreted Instrumentals. \\n\\n \\n\\n76 \\n\\n\\x0c In (128) the NP constituent which receives Partitive Genitive from Q pět (‘five‘) can \\nclearly be separated from Q and moved to some higher positions. The remaining QP, \\non the other hand, is free to move as well, as documented in (126).99  \\n\\nThe structure for the Czech analytic passive, i.e. for a structure with a post-\\nsyntactic [AV+A], was given in (73) and the following (129) is its modification for \\n(127). The co-indexation PHI marks the heads that enter into an agreement relation. \\n \\n(129)    \\n  \\n \\n \\n\\n (Vmax) Amax \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n     (Vmax) Amax  \\n     \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n         DP/PP  \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n     Qmax     \\n \\n\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n(V)AP \\n\\n  V0                 A0 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n      pět      štěňat \\nzraněn-       -n-0         zlým klukem \\n     fivePHI [NPpuppies]     hurt     ADJ.short.PHI    bad boyINSTR \\n\\n \\nThe structure which would remain after the extraction of the Q pět (‘five‘) in (129) is \\nnot a constituent, which is why it cannot move. The only constituent which can check \\nthe EPP feature of finite T  (or some pragmatic Topic/Focus feature in the high \\nperiphery of the clausal structure) is therefore the Qmax, which contains the Nmax \\nnominal complex  štěňat (‘puppies‘). This complex must therefore remain undivided, \\nas illustrated in (127). \\n\\n8  SUMMARY \\n\\nIn this paper we have presented an analysis of the Czech analytic passive in the \\nframework of  Chomskyan generative grammar. In Section 1 we started with the \\nintroduction of the phenomena in Czech, mentioning some of the problems which the \\nchosen framework has to face in its formal description. In Section 2 we introduced the \\nrecent generative Minimalist approach to the verbal projection and the sentence and \\nstated some related principles which we applied to the Czech data. \\n\\nOur analysis has been based on a detailed description of the properties of the \\n\\ncomponents of the analytic passive in Czech. The characteristics of the passive \\nauxiliary být (‘be‘) we discussed in section 1.3.1.We compared the passive auxiliary \\nwith a similar auxiliary used to form an analytic past tense in Czech so as to argue that \\nthe two elements are in fact quite distinct. We demonstrated that according to many \\n\\n \\n                                                 \\n99 We are not going to discuss here the landing side of the positions into which the \\n\\ncomponents of a complex quantified DP are moved. The interpretation and the peripheral \\npositions of most of the moved constituents suggest that the features triggering the \\nmovements of the AP and QP are the same features which trigger the pragmatically \\nmotivated word order sensitive to the Topic/Focus distinction in Czech. \\n\\n \\n\\n77 \\n\\n\\x0ctests, the past auxiliary behaved like a grammatical non-verbal formative, while the \\npassive auxiliary exhibits the properties of a full-fledged verb. Therefore we proposed \\ndistinct structural positions for these distinctly behaving auxiliaries in Section 3.  \\nThe second component of the analytic passive is the passive participle. In \\n\\nSection 4 we proposed that it is a complex (hybrid) form which consists of two \\ncategorially distinct parts, namely it is a [AV+A] derivate. In section 4.4.2  we argued \\nthat the verbal stem V and adjectival suffix A can merge at three distinct levels of \\nderivation. The verbal stem is uniformly present in the initial Numeration, but the \\nadjectival suffix is a grammatical item and does not need to enter the initial \\nNumeration: it can merge with the verbal stem later on, in syntax processing or at PF. \\nWe proposed that depending on the level of this unification of the complex, the \\nresulting three kinds of [AV+A] hybrids will exhibit a number of different predictable \\nproperties.  \\n\\nAs for the passive participle, we proposed that it represents the latest, post-\\nsyntactic merge of the adjectival head with the verbal stem. The adjectival suffix \\nmerges with the verbal stem only at the auditory-perception interface, and that is why \\nit shows verbal properties both during syntactic processing and at the level of Logical \\nForm. In Section 5 we described its derivational process in several levels \\nschematically summarised in the following scheme (130).  \\n\\nFirst the projection of the verbal head V Merges with its internal Argument Θ2 \\n\\n(Patient) creating SPEC(V). Second comes the projection of the head of the light verb \\nv* with a strong <+V> feature. The feature of v* is checked by Merging the non-\\nthematic AUX být (‘be‘), and this Merge prevents the attraction of V→ v*. The \\nresulting structure (a) does not allow generating (merge) of the external Argument Θ1 \\n(Agent) in a SPEC(v*) and (b) deprives V of its ability to assign structural Accusative. \\nThe AUX is however able to check the <+V> feature of the finite T and thus license \\nthe internal Argument Θ2 (Patient) by means of a structural Nominative.100 \\n\\n \\n                                                 \\n100 In (130) the adjectival suffix (the past participle adjectival morpheme ‘-(e)n/-t)’ is marked \\n\\nin bold italics. We argue that the suffix is not present during the process of syntactic \\nderivation but only at PF, where it has to acquire agreement morphology.  \\n\\n \\n\\n78 \\n\\n\\x0c(130)             Tmax \\n \\n \\nSPEC(T) \\nDPNOM \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nT0 \\n\\n    TP \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nv*max \\n\\n               [+D] \\n               [+V] SPEC(v*)           \\n\\n \\nArgument Θ1 \\n\\n \\n\\n     v*P \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nPavel    \\n \\n\\n                  V max/ A0 \\n\\nv* \\n \\n\\nSPEC(V) \\n\\n \\n        Argument Θ2 \\n\\n           V0 / A0 \\n\\n \\n \\nby+l \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n     \\n \\n          tby-  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n   tPavel   \\n\\n           V0  \\n        chvál- \\n\\nA0                   \\n-en(-Ø)          \\n\\n \\n \\nOur analysis of the passive shows that the properties of passive structures, namely \\n\\nBurzio’s Generalisation correlating the lack of Accusative with the lack of an Agent \\nArgument Theta role, are in fact both results of the alternative ways a derivation can \\nproceed. We argued that the strong <+V> feature of v* can be checked by a V→v* \\nmovement, which results in projecting an active structure and licensing both internal \\nand external Arguments. But the same feature <+V> of v* can alternatively be \\nchecked by merge of the non-thematic AUX být (‘be’), which results in a passive \\nstructure with a restricted ability to license Arguments. \\n\\nThe following Sections 6 and 7 have demonstrated in more detail the distinction \\n\\nbetween the three kinds of [AV+A] hybrids: (i) post-syntactic derivates (verbal passive \\nparticiples), (ii) syntactic derivates (adjectival passives), and (iii) lexical derivates \\n(deverbal adjectives). We demonstrated that these three forms are distinguishable by a \\nwide number of properties which reflect a range of distinctions between the categories \\nV and A.  \\n\\nWe have illustrated that these distinctions among the three structures can be found \\n\\nin all linguistic levels: In interpretation of the complexes, the meanings range from \\nadjectival [+STATE] to a possible verbal [+ACTIVITY] with independent temporal \\nand Aspectual frames. At the level of morphology we have demonstrated that different \\ntypes of agreement morpheme signal the derivational level of co-indexation, and so \\ndoes the range of possible verbal agreement morphemes. On the syntactic level the \\ndistinctions are reflected by distinct distribution and extraction possibilities.  \\n\\nNot all characteristics of the Czech passive structures have been discussed and \\n\\nproperly explained in this paper. We did not address at all e.g. certain restrictions on \\npassivisation, distinctions between verbal Theta Roles and semantically related \\nArguments of lexical adjectives or Agent-interpreted Instrumentals. However, our \\npaper has proposed a general and uniform approach to a circumscribed phenomenon \\n\\n \\n\\n79 \\n\\n\\x0cin a contemporary framework which has not been yet sufficiently applied to Czech \\ndata. We have demonstrated that regardless of the problems resulting from a relatively \\nfree constituent order in Czech, it is possible to apply general and presumably \\nuniversal morpho-syntactic criteria to the analysis of Czech data and to achieve a \\nreasonable level of descriptive and explanatory adequacy.  \\n \\nBIBLIOGRAPHY \\n\\nAFARLI, TOR  (1992) The Syntax of Norwegian Passive Constructions.
